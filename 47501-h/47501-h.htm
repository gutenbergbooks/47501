<h2>Preface</h2>

<h3><small>BY</small><br />

Miss <span class="smcap">Jessie Murray, m.b., b.s.</span></h3>


<p>In this little book Dr. Marie Stopes deals with subjects
which are generally regarded as too sacred for an entirely
frank treatment. Some earnest and delicate minds may
feel apprehensive that such frankness in details is "dangerous,"
because the effect on prurient minds might be to
give them food for their morbid fancies. It is just such a
fear which has been largely responsible for the silence and
mystery which have for so long been wrapped round the
sacred rites of mating.</p>

<p>The question now is, Has this reticence been carried too
far? Has it been carried so far that it now tends to defeat
its purpose of safeguarding public morals? There are many
who unhesitatingly answer such questions in the affirmative.
Their intimate knowledge of human lives compels them to
recognise that at least as much harm is done by silence as by
speaking out. Everything depends on how the matter is
presented.</p>

<p>Those who are shocked at the publication of such a book
as this on the ground that it gives material for impure minds
to sport with, need only reflect that such material is already
amply provided in certain comic papers, in hosts of inferior
novels, too often on the stage and film, and presented thus
in coarse and demoralising guise. It can do nothing but
good to such minds to meet the facts they are already so
familiar with in a totally new light.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are all the earnest and noble
young minds who seek to know what responsibilities they
are taking on themselves when they marry, and how they
may best meet these responsibilities. How few of them
have more than the vaguest ideas on the subject! How few
of them know how or where to obtain the help they desire!</p>

<p>They recoil from the coarse and impure sources of information
which are so accessible, and they hesitate to approach
those they have learned to regard as virtuous and modest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
realising that from such they will receive so little actual
information, and that so veiled as to be almost useless.</p>

<p>Dr. Stopes has attempted to meet the need of such seekers,
and her book will certainly be warmly welcomed by them.
It is calculated to prevent many of those mistakes which
wreck the happiness of countless lovers as soon as they are
actually married. If it did no more than this it would be
valuable indeed!</p>

<p>But there is an even more important aspect to be considered&mdash;the
effect on the child. In all civilised lands there
is a growing sense of responsibility towards the young.</p>

<p>The problems of their physical and mental nurture attract
more and more attention day by day. Eugenists, educationists,
physicians, politicians, philanthropists, and even
ordinary parents discuss and ponder, ponder and discuss,
matters both great and small which have a bearing on the
development of the child. By common consent the first
seven years of life are regarded as the most critical. It is
during these years that the foundations of the personality-to-be
are laid&mdash;"well and truly" or otherwise. It is during
these years that the deepest and most ineradicable impressions
are made in the plastic constitution of the child, arresting
or developing this or the other instinctive trend and fixing
it, often for life.</p>

<p>And it is during these years above all that the parents play
the most important role in the inner history of the child's
life, not so much by anything they directly teach through
verbal exhortations, warnings, or commands, as by those
subtler influences which are conveyed in gesture, tone, and
facial expression. The younger the child, the more is it
influenced through these more primitive modes of expression,
and quite as much when they are not directed towards itself
but are employed by the parents in their intimate relations
with one another in the presence of their apparently unobserving
child&mdash;the infant in its cot, the toddling baby by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
hearth, the little child to all appearance absorbed in its picture
book or toy.</p>

<p>Is it not of the utmost importance that these earliest
impressions should be of the finest nature? And should we
not therefore welcome all that may help&mdash;as this book can&mdash;to
make the living cradle of the next generation as full of
beauty and harmony as love and mutual understanding can?</p>

<p>The age-long conflict between the "lower" and the
"higher" impulses, between the primitive animal nature and
the specifically human developments of an altruistic and
ethical order, are fought afresh in each soul and in every
marriage.</p>

<p>We need to realise more clearly that the lower is never&mdash;ought
never to be&mdash;<em>eliminated</em> but rather <em>subsumed by the
higher</em>. No true harmony can be hoped for so long as one
factor or the other is ignored or repressed.</p>

<p>Dr. Stopes makes some very important biological suggestions
which should not be lightly dismissed. Further observation
is required to establish or disprove her theory of the
normal sexual cycle in women, but my own observation
certainly tends to confirm it.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Stopes</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The need of such guidance as you give is very
evident. After all, instinct in man is all insufficient to
determine social behaviour, and there is need of instruction
in the highest of physiological functions, that of reproduction,
as there is in the lower functions of eating and drinking&mdash;the
only difference being that in the former instruction
can be deferred to a later age. And there is no doubt that
in this case it is better to acquire knowledge by instruction
than by a type of experience which is nearly always sordid
and may be fraught with danger to the health of the individual
and of the family.</p>

<p>At the present time it is of vital importance to the State
that its marriages should be fruitful&mdash;in children, happiness,
and efficiency (and all three are closely connected).</p>

<p>If your book helps in securing this object, your trouble
will not have been in vain.</p>

<h2>Author's Preface</h2>

<p>More than ever to-day are happy homes needed.
It is my hope that this book may serve the State by
adding to their numbers. Its object is to increase
the joys of marriage, and to show how much sorrow may be
avoided.</p>

<p>The only secure basis for a present-day State is the welding
of its units in marriage; but there is rottenness and
danger at the foundations of the State if many of the
marriages are unhappy. To-day, particularly in the middle
classes in this country, marriage is far less really happy than
its surface appears. Too many who marry expecting joy
are bitterly disappointed; and the demand for "freedom"
grows; while those who cry aloud are generally unaware
that it is more likely to have been their own ignorance than
the "marriage-bond" which was the origin of their unhappiness.</p>

<p>It is never <em>easy</em> to make marriage a lovely thing; and it is
an achievement beyond the powers of the selfish, or the
mentally cowardly. Knowledge is needed and, as things are
at present, knowledge is almost unobtainable by those who
are most in want of it.</p>

<p>The problems of the sex-life are infinitely complex, and
for their solution urgently demand both sympathy and scientific
research.</p>

<p>I have some things to say about sex, which, so far as I am
aware, have not yet been said, things which seem to be of profound
importance to men and women who hope to make
their marriages beautiful.</p>

<p>This little book is less a record of a research than an
attempt to present in easily understandable form the clarified
and crystallised results of long and complex investigations.
Its simple statements are based on a very large number of
first-hand observations, on confidences from men and women
of all classes and types, and on facts gleaned from wide
reading.</p>

<p>My original contributions to the age-long problems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
marriage will principally be found in Chapters IV., V., and
VIII. The other chapters fill in what I hope is an undistorted
picture of the potential beauties and realities of
marriage.</p>

<p>The whole is written simply, and for the ordinary untrained
reader, though it embodies some observations which
will be new even to those who have made scientific
researches on the subjects of sex and human physiology.
These observations I intend to supplement and publish at
greater length and in more scientific language in another
place.</p>

<p>I do not now touch upon the many human variations and
abnormalities which bulk so largely in most books on sex,
nor do I deal with the many problems raised by incurably
unhappy marriages.</p>

<p>In the following pages I speak to those&mdash;and in spite of
all our neurotic literature and plays they are in the great
majority&mdash;who are nearly normal, and who are married or
about to be married, and hope, but do not know how, to
make their marriages beautiful and happy.</p>

<p>To the reticent, as to the conventional, it may seem a
presumption or a superfluity to speak of the details of the
most complex of all our functions. They ask: Is not
instinct enough? The answer is No. Instinct is <em>not</em>
enough. In every other human activity it has been realised
that training, the handing on of tradition are essential. As
Dr. Saleeby once wisely pointed out: A cat knows how to
manage her new-born kittens, how to bring them up and
teach them; a human mother does not know how to manage
her baby unless she is trained, either directly or by her own
quick observation of other mothers. A cat performs her
simple duties by instinct; a human mother has to be trained
to fulfil her very complex ones.</p>

<p>The same is true in the subtle realm of sex. In this
country, in modern times, the old traditions, the profound
primitive knowledge of the needs of both sexes, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
lost, and nothing but a muffled confusion of individual gossip
disturbs a silence, shamefaced or foul. Here and there, in
a family of fine tradition, a youth or maiden may learn some
of the mysteries of marriage, but the great majority of people
in our country have no glimmering of the supreme human
art, the art of love; while in books on advanced Physiology
and Medicine the gaps, the omissions, and even the misstatements
of bare fact are amazing.</p>

<p>In my first marriage I paid such a terrible price for sex-ignorance
that I feel that knowledge gained at such a cost
should be placed at the service of humanity. In this little
book average, healthy, mating creatures will find the key to
the happiness which should be the portion of each. It has
already guided some to happiness, and I hope it may save
some others years of heartache and blind questioning in the
dark.</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>I so much regret that many people have had to wait for the book, or been unable to get it.
The paper restrictions and difficulties of printing and binding have been great. At first the
publisher started with a modest edition of 2,000, not knowing what sort of reception the book
would have. Now that we know that people not only need the book but really <em>want</em> it we
hope to be able to keep it in print, instead of perforce having it so often "reprinting," as it has
been in the first few months of its existence.</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>To mention some of those whose appreciation and encouragement have so much helped the
progress of this book would be invidious, and to record them all would fill pages with mere
names; but there is one toward whom I have often desired to record in print my gratitude, and
that is Humphrey Verdon Roe. These thanks are rendered to him not in his private capacity
of adored and adoring husband, but in his more public office of sympathetic friend. Though
he did not meet me early enough to contribute to the text of the book itself his interest has
nevertheless been invaluable in creating a helpful atmosphere for the ever-increasing work the
book brings.</p>

<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO SIXTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>The difficulty and cost of printing still renders it inadvisable to incorporate throughout this
edition the number of small notes I should like to add, and the further points about which my
various correspondents have asked advice.</p>

<p>Among the subjects of inquiry, two are particularly prominent in the many letters which
readers send me. The most frequent questions concern the practical extension so many desire
to Chapter 9. This I have already dealt with separately in the short companion volume called
"Wise Parenthood." The other subject deals with the reverse state of affairs and is also an
extension of Chapter 9. This, for the present, I am placing at the end of the volume, Addition
4, page 119. Other points are dealt with on pages 114, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>Readers who have kindly contributed information, or have made requests for more light in
a new edition, will, I hope, be satisfied now before too long a time has elapsed.</p>

<h2><i>Letter from</i> Father <span class="smcap">Stanislaus St. John</span>, F.C., S.J.</h2>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Stopes</span>,</p>

<p>I have read "Married Love" with deep interest.
As a piece of thoughtful, scientific writing I find it admirable
throughout, and it seems to me that your theme could
not have been treated in more beautiful or more delicate
language, or with a truer ring of sympathy for those who,
through ignorance or want of thought, make shipwreck of
their married happiness.</p>

<p>Your clear exposition of the rhythmic curve of sex-feeling
and of the misinterpretation on the part of so many husbands
of what they call their wives' contrariness, arising
from their ignorance of its existence, should bring happiness
to many married couples whose lives are drifting apart
through want of knowledge. In the exercise of my ministry
I have repeatedly traced the beginnings of the rift to this
want of knowledge and consequently of sympathy.</p>

<p>So far we are in complete agreement, but our ways part
when you treat of birth control.</p>

<p>You write primarily as a scientist (though a very human
scientist), and so you are naturally mainly occupied with the
facts and conditions of what I may call our earth-life. I,
on the other hand, writing as a Catholic, regard our earth-life
as essentially and inseparably connected with an eternal
existence which reaches out beyond the grave. I look on
this life as utterly meaningless in itself, as a period which is
simply and solely a means to an end&mdash;Eternity&mdash;a period
of which all the circumstances of pleasure and pain can only
be explained and rightly used in their relation to this Eternity.</p>

<p>Let me take in illustration of my meaning the case you
give of the worn-out mother of twelve. The Catholic
belief is that the loss of health on her part for a few years
of life and the diminished vitality on the part of her later
children would be a very small price indeed to pay for an
endless happiness on the part of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>In our belief, then, the destruction of one spermatazoon is
not the question, but the deliberate prevention of an eternally
happy existence which, in the supposition, might arise from
its preservation. Holding, as we do, that the marriage-act
is the divinely ordained means by which man offers to God
the opportunity of creating an immortal being, we do not
believe that he may make use of this means and deliberately
frustrate it of its end without doing grave wrong.</p>

<p>You do me the honour of suggesting that I should write a
foreword to your book, but any foreword from me could
obviously only derive value from my position as a Catholic
priest, and that position is in opposition to this part of your
work.</p>

<p>I cannot end without thanking you very sincerely for
allowing me to read your book. Apart from what, as a
Catholic, I object to in it, it contains so much most helpful
matter that I feel sure it will bring to many a happiness in
married life now wanting through the ignorance and the
consequent want of sympathy which you so rightly deplore.</p>

<h3>Reply to Father St. John, S.J.</h3>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Leatherhead</span>, December 12, 1917.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Father St. John</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>Your letter wins my heart entirely by its appreciation
and kindness. It is a great help and encouragement to
find that we are so far in essential agreement, and that you
are so well disposed toward even part of my effort.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and I wish I could say it in burning words&mdash;it is
not because I am chiefly concerned with Time that I wrote
Chapter IX., but just because I am so acutely and so persistently
conscious that I am dealing with factors of Eternity.
<em>To me to-day is essentially a part of my Life Everlasting.</em></p>

<p>I cannot separate time and eternity, this world and the
next, as religious people often seem able to do; to me this
body is a tool in the service of (though not completely in
the control of) my immortal soul. Now it seems to me that
religious people&mdash;and even in your letter I fancy I detect
the same tendency (forgive me if I am wrong)&mdash;are too ready
to separate this world and the next, to act unreasonably or
cruelly here and to trust to Eternity, or the Hereafter, to
put all right. I do not think that is the way God wills us
to work out His plans now that He is giving us the knowledge
to do better.</p>

<p>Could there be anything more unreasonable or cruel than
to bring into life half a dozen children <em>doomed from birth</em>
to ill-health, poverty, and almost inevitable crime?</p>

<p>Christ forgave the thief upon the Cross, but He said, "Woe
unto him through whom offences come. It were better for
him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he
cast into the sea." Would Christ approve of deliberately
creating a thief by bringing forth a child who was one
inevitably through predictable weakness of physique and
mentality and an environment of poverty? ("Thief"
stands for criminals in general.)</p>

<p>But more, what about others, born dead, born imbecile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
thwarted of life by miscarriage, which tear and rend the
overburdened mother so that she is forced to neglect the
children she has, and her neglect turns them into thieves?
The poor, uneducated mother commits this crime through
ignorance: it is <em>we who know</em> and allow her to remain in
ignorance who are really responsible. Is not our withholding
God-given knowledge the greatest stumbling-block
of offence to these little ones, and shall we not deserve the
millstone round our necks?</p>

<p>Were everyone to have all the children physiologically
possible (now that infant mortality is so much reduced by
science) in a few centuries there would not be standing room
on the earth, and nowhere for a blade of grass or an ear of
corn to grow between the crowding feet. Is then a Roman
Catholic mother, the increases to whose large family get
punier and punier, to be privileged to go deliberately with
that host of puny children <em>at the expense of others</em>, not only
through that part of Eternity called Time, but through all
Eternity?</p>

<p>But, dear Father St. John, it is not my place to preach or
to argue with you, especially after your generous kindness
and appreciation. And, alas! I fully realise that even were
I granted the tongues of men and of angels, and I converted
you to my thought in this matter, you as a Roman Catholic
priest could not uphold a position in opposition to your
Church.</p>

<p>Oh, that the Churches would look to Christ's own words
instead of to the official Church interpretation of them!</p>

<p>I thank you very sincerely for your kindness to a stranger,
and remain, always yours respectfully,</p>

<h2>Chapter I.</h2>

<h3>The Heart's Desire</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>She gave him comprehension of the meaning of love: a word
in many mouths, not often explained. With her, wound in his
idea of her, he perceived it to signify a new start in our existence,
a finer shoot of the tree stoutly planted in good gross earth; the
senses running their live sap, and the minds companioned, and
the spirits made one by the whole-natured conjunction. In
sooth, a happy prospect for the sons and daughters of Earth,
divinely indicating more than happiness: the speeding of us,
compact of what we are, between the ascetic rocks and the sensual
whirlpools, to the creation of certain nobler races, now very dimly
imagined.&mdash;George Meredith's "Diana of the Crossways,"
chap. 37.</p></blockquote>


<p>Every heart desires a mate. For some reason
beyond our comprehension, nature has so
created us that we are incomplete in ourselves;
neither man nor woman singly can know the joy of
the performance of all the human functions; neither
man nor woman singly can create another human
being. This fact, which is expressed in our outward
divergencies of form, influences and colours the whole
of our lives; and there is nothing for which the inner-most
spirit of one and all so yearns as for a sense of
union with another soul, and the perfecting of oneself
which such union brings.</p>

<p>In all young people, unless they have inherited
depraved or diseased faculties, the old desire of our
race springs up afresh in its pristine beauty.</p>

<p>With the dreams and bodily changes of adolescence,
come to the youth and maiden the strange and
powerful impulses of the racial instinct. The bodily
differences of the two, now accentuated, become
mystical, alluring, enchanting in their promise.
Their differences unite and hold together the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and the woman so that their bodily union is the solid
nucleus of an immense fabric of interwoven strands
reaching to the uttermost ends of the earth; some
lighter than the filmiest cobweb, or than the softest
wave of music, iridescent with the colours, not only
of the visible rainbow, but of all the invisible glories
of the wave-lengths of the soul.</p>

<p>However much he may conceal it under assumed
cynicism, worldliness, or self-seeking, the heart of
every young man yearns with a great longing for the
fulfilment of the beautiful dream of a life-long union
with a mate. Each heart knows instinctively that it
is only a mate who can give full comprehension of all
the potential greatness in the soul, and have tender
laughter for all the child-like wonder that lingers so
enchantingly even in the white-haired.</p>

<p>The search for a mate is a quest for an understanding
heart clothed in a body beautiful, but unlike our own.</p>

<p>In the modern world, those who set out on high
endeavours or who consciously separate themselves
from the ordinary course of social life, are comparatively
few, and it is not to them that I am speaking.
The great majority of our citizens&mdash;both men and
women&mdash;after a time of waiting, or of exploring, or
of oscillating from one attraction to another, "settle
down" and marry.</p>

<p>Very few are actually so cynical as to marry without
the hope of happiness; while most young people, however
their words may deny it and however they may
conceal their tender hopes by an assumption of
cynicism, reveal that they are conscious of entering
on a new and glorious state by their radiant looks and
the joyous buoyancy of their actions. In the kisses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and the hand touch of the betrothed are a zest and
exhilaration which stir the blood like wine. The two
read poetry, listen entranced to music which echoes
the songs of their pulses, and see reflected in each
other's eyes the beauty of the world. In the midst
of this celestial intoxication they naturally assume
that, as they are on the threshold of their lives, so too
they are in but the ante-chamber of their experience
of spiritual unity.</p>

<p>The more sensitive, the more romantic, and the
more idealistic is the young person of either sex, the
more his or her soul craves for some kindred soul with
whom the whole being can unite. But all have some
measure of this desire, even the most prosaic, and we
know from innumerable stories of real life that the
sternest man of affairs, he who may have worldly
success of every sort, may yet, through the lack of
a real mate, live with a sense almost as though the
limbs of his soul had been amputated. Edward
Carpenter has beautifully voiced this longing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That there should exist one other person in the world towards
whom all openness of interchange should establish itself, from
whom there should be no concealment; whose body should be as
dear to one, in every part, as one's own; with whom there should
be no sense of Mine or Thine, in property or possession; into
whose mind one's thoughts should naturally flow, as it were to
know themselves and to receive a new illumination; and between
whom and oneself there should be a spontaneous rebound of
sympathy in all the joys and sorrows and experiences of life; such
is perhaps one of the dearest wishes of the soul.&mdash;"Love's Coming
of Age."</p></blockquote>

<p>It may chance that someone into whose hands this
book falls may protest that he or she has never felt
the fundamental yearning to form a part of that trinity
which alone is the perfect expression of humanity. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that is so, it is possible that all unconsciously he may
be suffering from a real malady&mdash;sex anæsthesia. This
is the name given to an inherent coldness, which,
while it lacks the usual human impulse of tenderness,
is generally quite unconscious of its lack. It may
even be that the reader's departure from the ordinary
ranks of mankind is still more fundamental, in which
case, instead of sitting in judgment on the majority,
he will do well to read some such book as "The
Sexual Question" (English translation 1908) by the
famous Professor August Forel, in order that his own
nature may be made known to him. He may then
discover to which type of our widely various
humanity he belongs. He need not read my book,
for it is written about, and it is written for, ordinary
men and women who, feeling themselves incomplete,
yearn for a union that will have power not only to
make a fuller and richer thing of their own lives, but
which will place them in a position to use their sacred
trust as creators of lives to come.</p>

<p>It has happened many times in human history that
individuals have not only been able to conquer this
natural craving for a mate, but have set up celibacy
as a higher ideal. In its most beautiful expression
and sublimest manifestations, the celibate ideal has
proclaimed a world-wide love, in place of the narrower
human love of home and children. Many saints and
sages, reformers and dogmatists have modelled their
lives on this ideal. But such individuals cannot be
taken as the standard of the <em>race</em>, for they are out of
its main current: they are branches which may flower,
but never fruit in a bodily form.</p>

<p>In this world our spirits not only permeate matter
but find their only expression through its medium.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
So long as we are human we must have bodies, and
bodies obey chemical and physiological, as well as
spiritual laws.</p>

<p>If our race as a whole set out to pursue an ideal
which must ultimately eliminate bodies altogether,
it is clear that very soon we should find the conditions
of our environment so altered that we could no longer
speak of the human race.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we <em>are</em> human. We each and
all live our lives according to laws, some of which
we have begun to understand, many of which are
completely hidden from us. The most complete
human being is he or she who consciously or unconsciously
obeys the profound physical laws of our being
in such a way that the spirit receives as much help and
as little hindrance from the body as possible. A mind
and spirit finds its fullest expression thwarted by the
misuse, neglect or gross abuse of the body in which
it dwells.</p>

<p>By the ignorant or self-indulgent breaking of
fundamental laws endless harmonies are dislocated.
The modern, small-minded ascetic endeavours to
grow spiritually by destroying his physical instincts
instead of by using them. But I would proclaim that
we are set in the world so to mould matter that it
may express our spirits; that it is presumption to profess
to fight the immemorial laws of our physical
being, and that he who does so loses unconsciously
the finest flux in which wondrous new creations take
their rise.</p>

<p>To use a homely simile&mdash;one might compare two
human beings to two bodies charged with electricity
of different potentials. Isolated from each other the
electric forces within them are invisible, but if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
come into the right juxtaposition the force is transmuted,
and a spark, a glow of burning light arises
between them. Such is love.</p>

<p>From the body of the loved one's simple, sweetly
coloured flesh, which our immemorial creature instincts
urge us to desire, there springs not only the
wonder of a new bodily life, but also the enlargement
of the horizon of human sympathy and the glow of
spiritual understanding which a solitary soul could
never have attained alone.</p>

<p>Many reading this may feel conscious that they
have had physical union without such spiritual results,
perhaps even without an accession of ordinary happiness.
If that is so, it can only be because, consciously
or unconsciously, they have broken some of
the profound laws which govern the love of man and
woman. Only by learning to hold a bow correctly
can one draw music from a violin: only by obedience
to the laws of the lower plane can one step up to the
plane above.</p>

<h2>Chapter II.</h2>

<h3>The Broken Joy</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>What shall be done to quiet the heart-cry of the world? How
answer the dumb appeal for help we so often divine below eyes
that laugh?&mdash;Æ. in "The Hero in Man."</p></blockquote>


<p>Dreaming of happiness, feeling that at last
they have each found the one who will give
eternal understanding and tenderness, the
young man and maiden marry.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>At first, in the time generally called the honeymoon,
the unaccustomed freedom and the sweetness of the
relation often does bring real happiness. How long
does it last? Too often a far shorter time than is
generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>In the first joy of their union it is hidden from the
two young people that they know little or nothing
about the fundamental laws of each other's being.
Much of the sex-attraction (not only among human
beings, but even throughout the whole world of
living creatures) depends upon the differences between
the two that pair; and probably taking them all
unawares, those very differences which drew them together
now begin to work their undoing.</p>

<p>But so long as the first illusion that each understands
the other is supported by the thrilling delight
of ever-fresh discoveries, the sensations lived through
are so rapid and so joyous that the lovers do not
realise that there is no firm foundation of real mutual
knowledge beneath their feet. While even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
happiest pair may know of divergencies about religion,
politics, social custom, and opinions on things
in general, these, with goodwill, patience, and intelligence
on either side, can be ultimately adjusted, because
in all such things there is a common meeting
ground for the two. Human beings, while differing
widely about every conceivable subject in such human
relations, have at least <em>thought</em> about them, threshed
them out, and discussed them openly for generations.</p>

<p>But about the much more fundamental and vital
problems of sex, there is a lack of knowledge so
abysmal and so universal that its mists and shadowy
darkness have affected even the few who lead us, and
who are prosecuting research in these subjects. And
the two young people begin to suffer from fundamental
divergencies, before perhaps they realise that
such exist, and with little prospect of ever gaining a
rational explanation of them.</p>

<p>Nearly all those whose own happiness seems to be
dimmed or broken count themselves exceptions, and
comfort themselves with the thought of some of their
friends, who, they feel sure, have attained the happiness
which they themselves have missed.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that happy people, like
happy nations, have no history&mdash;they are silent about
their own affairs. Those who talk about their
marriage are generally those who have missed the
happiness they expected. True as this may be in
general, it is not permanently and profoundly true,
and there are people who are reckoned, and still
reckon themselves, happy, but who yet unawares
reveal the secret disappointment which clouds their
inward peace.</p>

<p>Leaving out of account <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femmes incomprises</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and all the innumerable neurotic, super-sensitive, and
slightly abnormal people, it still remains an astonishing
and tragic fact that so large a proportion of
marriages lose their early bloom and are to some
extent unhappy.</p>

<p>For years many men and women have confided to
me the secrets of their lives; and of all the innumerable
marriages of which the inner circumstances are
known to me, there are tragically few which approach
even humanly attainable joy.</p>

<p>Many of those considered by the world, by the
relatives, <em>even by the loved and loving partner</em>, to be
perfectly happy marriages, are secretly shadowed to
the more sensitive of the pair.</p>

<p>Where the bride is, as are so many of our educated
girls, composed of virgin sweetness shut in ignorance,
the man is often the first to create "the rift within the
lute"; but his suffering begins almost simultaneously
with hers. The surface freedom of our women has
not materially altered, cannot materially alter, the
pristine purity of a girl of our northern race. She
generally has not even the capacity to imagine the
basic facts of physical marriage, and her bridegroom
may shock her without knowing that he was doing so.
Then, unconscious of the nature, and even perhaps of
the existence of his fault, he is bewildered and pained
by her inarticulate pain.</p>

<p>Yet I think, nevertheless, it is true that in the early
days of marriage the young man is often even more
sensitive, more romantic, more easily pained about
all ordinary things, and he enters marriage hoping for
an even higher degree of spiritual and bodily unity
than does the girl or the woman. But the man is more
quickly blunted, more swiftly rendered cynical, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
readier to look upon happiness as a Utopian dream
than is his mate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the woman is slower to realise
disappointment, and more often by the sex-life of
marriage is of the two the more <em>profoundly</em> wounded,
with a slow corrosive wound that eats into her very
being.</p>

<p>Perfect happiness is a unity composed of a myriad
essences; and this one supreme thing is exposed to
the attacks of countless destructive factors.</p>

<p>Were I to touch upon all the possible sources of
marital disappointment and unhappiness, this book
would expand into a dozen bulky volumes. As I am
addressing those who I assume have read, or can read,
other books written upon various ramifications of the
subject, I will not discuss the themes which have
been handled by many writers, nor deal with abnormalities,
which fill so large a part of most books on
sex.</p>

<p>In the last few years there has been such an awakening
to the realisation of the corrosive horror of all
aspects of prostitution that there is no need to labour
the point that no marriage can be happy where
the husband has, in buying another body, sold
his own health with his honour, and is tainted with
disease.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary, in speaking to well-meaning,
optimistic young couples, to enlarge upon the obvious
dangers of drunkenness, self-indulgence, and the
cruder forms of selfishness. It is with the subtler infringements
of the fundamental laws we have to deal.
And the prime tragedy is that, as a rule, the two young
people are both unaware of the existence of such decrees.
Yet here, as elsewhere in Nature, the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
breaker is punished whether he is aware of the existence
of the law he breaks or not.</p>

<p>In the state of ignorance which so largely predominates
to-day, the first sign that things are amiss between
the two who thought they were entering paradise together,
is generally a sense of loneliness, a feeling that
the one who was expected to have all in common is
outside some experience, some subtle delight, and
fails to understand the needs of the loved one. Trivialities
are often the first indicators of something
which takes its roots unseen in the profoundest depths.
The girl may sob for hours over something so trifling
that she cannot even put into words its nature, while
the young man, thinking that he had set out with his
soul's beloved upon an adventure into celestial distances,
may find himself apparently up against a
barrier in her which appears as incomprehensible as it
is frivolous.</p>

<p>Then, so strange is the mystical inter-relation between
our bodies, our minds, and our souls, that for
crimes committed in ignorance of the dual functions
of the married pair, and the laws which harmonise
them, the punishments are reaped on planes quite
diverse, till new and ever new misunderstandings
appear to spring spontaneously from the soil of their
mutual contact. Gradually or swiftly each heart
begins to hide a sense of boundless isolation. It may
be urged that this statement is too sweeping. It is,
however, based on innumerable actual lives. I have
heard from women whose marriages are looked upon
by all as the happiest possible expressions of human
felicity, the details of secret pain of which they have
allowed their husbands no inkling. Many men will
know how they have hidden from their beloved wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a sense of dull disappointment, perhaps at her coldness
in the marital embrace, or from the sense that there
is in her something elusive which always evades their
grasp.</p>

<p>This profound sense of misunderstanding finds
readier expression in the cruder and more ordinary
natures. The disappointment of the married is expressed
not only in innumerable books and plays, but
even in comic papers and all our daily gossip.</p>

<p>Now that so many "movements" are abroad, folk
on all sides are emboldened to express the opinion that
it is marriage itself which is at fault. Many think that
merely by loosening the bonds, and making it possible
to start afresh with someone else, their lives would be
made harmonious and happy. But often such reformers
forget that he or she who knows nothing of
the way to make marriage great and beautiful with
one partner, is not likely to succeed with another. Only
by a reverent study of the Art of Love can the beauty
of its expression be realised in linked lives.</p>

<p>And even when once learnt, the Art of Love takes
<em>time</em> to practise. As Ellen Key says, "Love requires
peace, love will dream; it cannot live upon the remnants
of our time and our personality."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Love loses, in the haste and
bustle of the modern turmoil, not only its charm and
graces, but some of its vital essence. The evil results
of the haste which so infests and poisons us are often
felt much more by the woman than by the man. The
over-stimulation of city life tends to "speed up" the
man's reactions, but to retard hers. To make matters
worse, even for those who have leisure to spend on
love-making, the opportunities for peaceful, romantic
dalliance are less to-day in a city with its tubes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
cinema shows than in woods and gardens where the
pulling of rosemary or lavender may be the sweet
excuse for the slow and profound mutual rousing of
passion. Now physical passion, so swiftly stimulated
in man, tends to override all else, and the untutored
man seeks but one thing&mdash;the accomplishment of
desire. The woman, for it is in her nature so to do,
forgives the crudeness, but sooner or later her love
revolts, probably in secret, and then for ever after,
though she may command an outward tenderness, she
has nothing within but scorn and loathing for the act
which should have been a perpetually recurring
entrancement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So many people are now born and bred in artificial and false
surroundings, that even the elementary fact that the acts of love
should be <em>joyous</em> is unknown to them. A distinguished American
doctor made this amazing statement: "I do not believe mutual
pleasure in the sexual act has any particular bearing on the happiness
of life." (Amer. Med. Assoc. Rep. 1900.) This is, perhaps,
an extreme case, yet so many distinguished medical men, gynecologists
and physiologists, are either in ignorance or error regarding
some of the profoundest facts of human sex-life, that it is
not surprising that ordinary young couples, however hopeful,
should break and destroy the joy that might have been their life-long
crown.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter III.</h2>

<h3>Woman's "Contrariness"</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Oh! for that Being whom I can conceive to be in the world,
though I shall not live to prove it. One to whom I might have
recourse in all my Humours and Dispositions: in all my Distempers
of Mind, visionary Causes of Mortification, and Fairy
Dreams of Pleasure. I have been trying to train up a Lady or
two for these good offices of Friendship, but hitherto I must not
boast of my success.&mdash;<small>HERRICK</small>.</p></blockquote>


<p>What is the fate of the average man who
marries, happily and hopefully, a girl well
suited to him? He desires with his whole
heart a mutual, life-long happiness. He marries with
the intention of fulfilling every injunction given him
by father, doctor, and friend. He is considerate in
trifles, he speaks no harsh words, he and his bride
go about together, walk together, read together, and
perhaps, if they are very advanced, even work together.
But after a few months, or maybe a few years
of marriage they seem to have drifted apart, and he
finds her often cold and incomprehensible. Few men
will acknowledge this even to their best friends. But
each heart knows its own pain.</p>

<p>He may at times laugh, and in the friendliest spirit
tease his wife about her contrariness. That is taken
by everyone to mean nothing but a playful concealment
of his profound love. Probably it is. But
gnawing at the very roots of his love is a hateful
little worm&mdash;the sense that she <em>is contrary</em>. He
feels that she is at times inexplicably cold; that,
sometimes, when he has "done nothing" she will
have tears in her eyes, irrational tears which she
cannot explain.</p>

<p>He observes that one week his tender love-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and romantic advances win her to smiles and joyous
yielding, and then perhaps a few days later the same,
or more impassioned, tenderness on his part is met
by coldness or a forced appearance of warmth, which,
while he may make no comment upon it, hurts him
acutely. And this deep, inexplicable hurt is often
the beginning of the end of his love. Men like to
feel that they understand their dearest one, and that
she is a rational being.</p>

<p>After inexplicable misunderstanding has continued
for some time, if the man is of at all a jealous nature
he will search his wife's acquaintances for someone
whom she may have met, for someone who may
momentarily have diverted her attention. For however
hard it is for the natural man to believe that
anyone could step into <em>his</em> shoes, some are ready to
seek the explanation of their own ill success in a rival.
On some occasion when her coldness puzzles him the
man is perhaps conscious that his love, his own desires,
are as ardent as they were a few days before;
then, knowing so intimately his own heart, he is sure
of the steadiness of its love, and he feels acutely the
romantic passion to which her beauty stirs him; he
remembers perhaps that a few days earlier his ardour
had awakened a response in her; therefore, he reaches
what appears to him to be the infallible logical deduction&mdash;that
either there must be some rival or his
bride's nature is incomprehensible, contrary, capricious.
Both thoughts to madden.</p>

<p>With capriciousness, man in general has little
patience. Caprice renders his best efforts null and
void. Woman's caprice is, or appears to be, a negation
of reason. And as reason is man's most precious
and hard-won faculty, the one which has raised mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
from the ranks of the brute creation, he cannot
bear to see it apparently flouted.</p>

<p>That his bride should lack logic and sweet reasonableness
is a flaw it hurts him to recognise in her. He
has to crush the thought down.</p>

<p>It may then happen that the young man, himself
pained and bewildered at having pained his bride by
the very ardour of his affection, may strive to please
her by placing restraint upon himself. He may ask
himself: Do not religious and many kinds of moral
teachers preach restraint to the man? He reads
the books written for the guidance of youth, and
finds "restraint," "self-control," in general terms
(and often irrationally) urged in them all. His next
step may then be to curtail the expression of his tender
feelings, and to work hard and late in the evenings
instead of kissing his bride's fingers and coming to
her for sweet communion in the dusk.</p>

<p>And then, if he is at all observant, he may be
aggrieved and astonished to find her again wistful or
hurt. With the tender longing to <em>understand</em>, which
is so profound a characteristic in all the best of our
young men, he begs, implores, or pets her into telling
him some part of the reason for her fresh grievance.
He discovers to his amazement that <em>this</em> time she is
hurt because he had not made those very advances
which so recently had repelled her, and had been with
such difficulty repressed by his intellectual efforts.</p>

<p>He asks himself in despair: What is a man to do?
If he is "educated," he probably devours all the books
on sex he can obtain. But in them he is not likely to
find much real guidance. He learns from them that
"restraint" is advised from every point of view, but
according to the character of the author he will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
that "restraint" means having the marriage relations
with his wife not more than three times a week, or
once a month&mdash;or never at all except for the procreation
of children. He finds no <em>rational</em> guidance based
on natural law.</p>

<p>According to his temperament then, he may begin
to practise "restraint."</p>

<p>But it may happen, and indeed it has probably happened
in every marriage once or many times, that the
night comes when the man who has heroically practised
restraint, accidentally discovers his wife in tears
on her solitary pillow.</p>

<p>He seeks for advice indirectly from his friends,
perhaps from his doctor. But can his local doctor or
his friends tell him more than the chief European
authorities on this subject? The famous Professor
Forel ("The Sexual Question," transl. 1908) gives
the following advice:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reformer, Luther, who was a practical man, laid down the
average rule of two or three connections a week in marriage, at
the time of highest sexual power. I may say that my numerous
observations as a physician have generally confirmed this rule,
which seems to me to conform very well to the normal state to
which man<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> has become gradually adapted during thousands of
years. Husbands who would consider this average as an imprescriptable
right would, however, make wrong pretensions, for it
is quite possible for a normal man to contain himself much longer,
and it is his duty to do so, not only when his wife is ill, but also
during menstruation and pregnancy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many men will not be so considerate as to follow
this advice, which represents a high standard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
living; but, on the other hand, there are many who
are willing to go not only so far, but further than
this in their self-suppression in order to attain their
heart's desire, the happiness of their mate, and consequently
their own life's joy.</p>

<p>However willing they may be to go further, the
great question for the man is: Where?</p>

<p>There are innumerable leaders anxious to lead in
many different directions. The young husband may
try first one and then the other, and still find his wife
unsatisfied, incomprehensible&mdash;capricious. Then it
may be that, disheartened, he tires, and she sinks into
the dull apathy of acquiescence in her "wifely duty."
He is left with an echo of resentment in his heart. If
only she had not been so capricious, they would still
have been happy, he fancies.</p>

<p>Many writers, novelists, poets and dramatists have
represented the uttermost tragedy of human life as
due to the incomprehensible contrariness of the feminine
nature. The kindly ones smile, perhaps a little
patronisingly, and tell us that women are more instinctive,
more child-like, less reasonable than men. The
bitter ones sneer or reproach or laugh at this in women
they do not understand, and which, baffling <em>their</em>
intellect, appears to them to be irrational folly.</p>

<p>It seems strange that those who search for natural
law in every province of our universe should have
neglected the most vital subject, the one which concerns
us all infinitely more than the naming of planets
or the collecting of insects. Woman is <em>not</em> essentially
capricious; some of the laws of her being might
have been discovered long ago had the existence of
law been suspected. But it has suited the general
structure of society much better for men to shrug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
their shoulders and smile at women as irrational and
capricious creatures, to be courted when it suited
them, not to be studied.</p>

<p>Vaguely, perhaps, men have realised that much of
the charm of life lies in the sex-<em>differences</em> between
men and women; so they have snatched at the easy
theory that women differ from themselves by being
capricious. Moreover, by attributing to mere caprice
the coldness which at times comes over the most
ardent woman, man was unconsciously justifying
himself for at any time coercing her to suit himself.</p>

<p>Circumstances have so contrived that hitherto the
explorers and scientific investigators, the historians
and statisticians, the poets and artists have been mainly
men. Consequently woman's side of the joint life
has found little or no expression. Woman has been
content to mould herself to the shape desired by man
wherever possible, and she has stifled her natural feelings
and her own deep thoughts as they welled up.</p>

<p>Most women have never realised intellectually, but
many have been dimly half-conscious, that woman's
nature is set to rhythms over which man has no more
control than he has over the tides of the sea. While
the ocean can subdue and dominate man and laugh at
his attempted restrictions, woman has bowed to man's
desire over her body, and, regardless of its pulses, he
approaches her or not as is his will. Some of her
rhythms defy him&mdash;the moon-month tide of menstruation,
the cycle of ten moon-months of bearing
the growing child and its birth at the end of the tenth
wave&mdash;these are essentials too strong to be mastered
by man. But the subtler ebb and flow of woman's sex
has escaped man's observation or his care.</p>

<p>If a swimmer comes to a sandy beach when the tide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is out and the waves have receded, leaving sand where
he had expected deep blue water&mdash;does he, baulked of
his bathe, angrily call the sea "capricious"?</p>

<p>But the tenderest bridegroom finds only caprice in
his bride's coldness when she yields her sacrificial
body while her sex-tide is at the ebb.</p>

<p>There is another side to this problem, one perhaps
even less considered by society. There is the tragic
figure of the loving woman whose love-tide is at the
highest, and whose husband does not recognise the
delicate signs of her ardour. In our anæmic artificial
days it often happens that the man's desire is a
surface need, quickly satisfied, colourless, and lacking
beauty, and that he has no knowledge of the rich
complexities of love-making which an initiate of
love's mysteries enjoys. To such a man his wife may
indeed seem petulant, capricious, or resentful without
reason.</p>

<p>Welling up in her are the wonderful tides, scented
and enriched by the myriad experiences of the human
race from its ancient days of leisure and flower-wreathed
love-making, urging her to transports and
to self-expressions, were the man but ready to take
the first step in the initiative or to recognise and
welcome it in her. Seldom dare any woman, still
more seldom dare a wife, risk the blow at her
heart which would be given were she to offer
charming love-play to which the man did not
respond. To the initiate she will be able to reveal
that the tide is up by a hundred subtle signs,
upon which he will seize with delight. But if
her husband is blind to them there is for her nothing
but silence, self-suppression, and their inevitable
sequence of self-scorn, followed by resentment towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the man who places her in such a position of
humiliation while talking of his "love."</p>

<p>So unaware of the elements of the physiological
reactions of women are many modern men that the
case of Mrs. G. is not exceptional. Her husband
was accustomed to pet her and have relations
with her frequently, but yet he never took any
trouble to rouse in her the necessary preliminary
feeling for mutual union. She had married as a
very ignorant girl, but often vaguely felt a sense
of something lacking in her husband's love. Her
husband had never kissed her except on the lips
and cheek, but once at the crest of the wave of
her sex-tide (all unconscious that it was so) she
felt a yearning to feel his head, his lips, pressed against
her bosom. The sensitive inter-relation between a
woman's breasts and the rest of her sex-life is not only
a bodily thrill, but there is a world of poetic beauty in
the longing of a loving woman for the unconceived
child which melts in mists of tenderness toward her
lover, the soft touch of whose lips can thus rouse her
mingled joy. Because she shyly asked him, Mrs. G.'s
husband gave her one swift unrepeated kiss upon her
bosom. He was so ignorant that he did not know
that her husband's lips upon her breast melt a wife to
tenderness and are one of a husband's first and surest
ways to make her physically ready for complete union.
In this way he inhibited her natural desire, and as he
never did anything to stir it, she never had any
physical pleasure in their relation. Such prudish or
careless husbands, content with their own satisfaction,
little know the pent-up aching, or even resentment,
which may eat into a wife's heart, and ultimately
may affect her whole health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Often the man is also the victim of the purblind
social customs which make sex-knowledge <em>tabu</em>.</p>

<p>It has become a tradition of our social life that the
ignorance of woman about her own body and that of
her future husband is a flower-like innocence. And to
such an extreme is this sometimes pushed, that not
seldom is a girl married unaware that married life will
bring her into physical relations with her husband
fundamentally different from those with her brother.
When she discovers the true nature of his body, and
learns the part she has to play as a wife, she may refuse
utterly to agree to her husband's wishes. I know one
pair of which the husband, chivalrous and loving, had
to wait years before his bride recovered from the shock
of the discovery of the meaning of marriage and was
able to allow him a natural relation. There have been
not a few brides whom the horror of the first night of
marriage with a man less considerate has driven to
suicide or insanity.</p>

<p>That girls can reach a marriageable age without
some knowledge of the realities of marriage would
seem incredible were it not a fact. One highly-educated
lady intimately known to me told me that
when she was about eighteen she suffered many
months of agonising apprehension that she was about
to have a baby because a man had snatched a kiss from
her lips at a dance.</p>

<p>When girls so brought up are married it is a <em>rape</em>
for the husband to insist on his "marital rights" at
once. It will be difficult or impossible for such a bride
ever after to experience the joys of sex-union, for such
a beginning must imprint upon her consciousness
the view that the man's animal nature dominates
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>In a magazine I came across a poem which vividly
expresses this peculiarly feminine sorrow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">... To mate with men who have no soul above<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Earth grubbing; who, the bridal night, forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Killed sparks that rise from instinct fires of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And left us frozen things, alone to fashion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our souls to dust, masked with the name of wife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Long years of youth&mdash;love years&mdash;the years of passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yawning before us. So, shamming to the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All shrivelled by the side of him we wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoping that peace may riper years attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mere odalisques are we&mdash;well housed, well fed.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="sig2">
<span class="smcap">Katherine Nelson.</span>
</p>

<p>Many men who enter marriage sincerely and
tenderly may yet have some previous experience of
bought "love." It is then not unlikely that they may
fall into the error of explaining their wife's experiences
in terms of the reactions of the prostitute. They
argue that, because the prostitute showed physical
excitement and pleasure in union, if the bride or
wife does not do so, then she is "cold" or "under-sexed."
They may not realise that often all the bodily
movements which the prostitute makes are studied
and simulated because her client enjoys his climax best
when the woman in his arms simultaneously thrills.</p>

<p>As Forel says ("The Sexual Question," 1908,
Engl. trans.): "The company of prostitutes often
renders men incapable of understanding feminine
psychology, for prostitutes are hardly more than automata
trained for the use of male sensuality. When
men look among these for the sexual psychology of
woman they find only their own mirror."</p>

<p>Fate is often cruel to men, too. More high-spirited
young men than the world imagines strive for and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
keep their purity to give their brides; if such a man
then marries a woman who is soiled, or, on the other
hand, one who is so "pure" and prudish that she
denies him union with her body, his noble achievement
seems bitterly vain. On the other hand, it may be
that after years of fighting with his hot young blood
a man has given up and gone now and again for relief
to prostitutes, and then later in life has met the woman
who is his mate, and whom, after remorse for his soiled
past, and after winning her forgiveness for it, he
marries. Then, unwittingly, he may make the wife
suffer either by interpreting her in the light of the
other women or perhaps (though this happens less frequently)
by setting her absolutely apart from them. I
know of a man who, after a loose life, met a woman
whom he reverenced and adored. He married her,
but to preserve her "purity," her difference from the
others, he never consummated his marriage with her.
She was strangely unhappy, for she loved him passionately
and longed for children. She appeared to
him to be pining "capriciously" when she became
thin and neurotic.</p>

<p>Perhaps this man might have seen his own behaviour
in a truer light had he known that some
creatures simply <em>die</em> if unmated (see p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a> Appendix).</p>

<p>The idea that woman is lowered by sex intercourse
is very deeply rooted in our present society. Many
sources have contributed to this mistaken idea, not
the least powerful being the ascetic ideal of the early
Church and the fact that man has <em>used</em> woman as his
instrument so often regardless of her wishes.
Women's education, therefore, and the trend of
social feeling, has largely been in the direction of
freeing her from this and thus mistakenly encouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the idea that sex-life is a low, physical, and degrading
necessity which a pure woman is above enjoying.</p>

<p>In marriage the husband has used his "marital
right"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of intercourse when <em>he</em> wished it. Both law
and custom have strengthened the view that he has
the right to approach his wife whenever he wishes,
and that she has no wishes and no fundamental needs
in the matter at all.</p>

<p>That woman has a rhythmic sex-tide which, if its
indications were obeyed, would ensure not only her
enjoyment, but would explode the myth of her
capriciousness, seems not to be suspected. We have
studied the wave-lengths of water, of sound, of light;
but when will the sons and daughters of men study
the sex-tide in woman and learn the laws of her
Periodicity of Recurrence of desire?</p>

<h2>Chapter IV.</h2>

<h3>The Fundamental Pulse</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The judgments of men concerning women are very rarely
matters of cold scientific observation, but are coloured both by
their own sexual emotions and by their own moral attitude toward
the sexual impulse.... [Men's] Statements about the sexual
impulses of women often tell us less about women than about the
persons who make them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. Ellis</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p>By the majority of "nice" people woman is
supposed to have no spontaneous sex impulses.
By this I do not mean a sentimental
"falling in love," but a physical, a physiological state
of stimulation which arises spontaneously and quite
apart from any particular man. It is in truth the
<em>creative</em> impulse, and is an expression of a high power
of vitality. So widespread in our country is the view
that it is only depraved women who have such feelings
(especially before marriage) that most women
would rather die than own that they <em>do</em> at times feel
a physical yearning indescribable, but as profound as
hunger for food. Yet many, many women have
shown me the truth of their natures when I have
simply and naturally assumed that of course they feel
it&mdash;being normal women&mdash;and have asked them
only: <em>When?</em> From their replies I have collected
facts which are sufficient to overturn many ready-made
theories about women.</p>

<p>Some of the ridiculous absurdities which go by the
name of science may be illustrated by the statement
made by Windscheid in the Centralblatt für Gynäkologie:
"In the normal woman, especially of the
higher social classes, the sexual instinct is acquired,
not inborn; when it is inborn, or awakens by itself,
there is <em>abnormality</em>. Since women do not know this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
instinct before marriage, they do not miss it when
they have no occasion in life to learn it." (Ellis transl.)</p>

<p>The negation of this view is expressed in the fable
of Hera quoted by Ellen Key. Hera sent Iris to earth
to seek out three virtuous and perfectly chaste
maidens who were unsoiled by any dreams of love.
Iris found them, but could not take them back to
Olympus, for they had already been sent for to replace
the superannuated Furies in the infernal regions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is true that the whole education of
girls, which so largely consists in the concealment of
the essential facts of life from them; and the positive
teaching so prevalent that the racial instincts are low
and shameful; and also the social condition which
places so many women in the position of depending
on their husband's will not only for the luxuries but
for the necessaries of life, have all tended to inhibit
natural sex-impulses in women, and to conceal and
distort what remains.</p>

<p>It is also true that in our northern climate women
are on the whole naturally less persistently stirred than
southerners; and it is further true that with the delaying
of maturity, due to our ever-lengthening youth, it
often happens that a woman is approaching or even
past thirty years before she is awake to the existence of
the profoundest calls of her nature. For many years
before that, however, the unrealised influence, diffused
throughout her very system, has profoundly affected
her. It is also true that (partly due to the inhibiting
influences of our customs, traditions and social code)
women may marry before it wakes, and may remain
long after marriage entirely unconscious that it surges
subdued within them. For innumerable women, too,
the husband's regular habits of intercourse, claiming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
her both when she would naturally enjoy union and
when it is to some degree repugnant to her, have
tended to flatten out the billowing curves of the line
of her natural desire. One result, apparently little
suspected, of using the woman as a passive instrument
for man's need has been, in effect, to make her
that and nothing more. Those men&mdash;and there are
many&mdash;who complain of the lack of ardour in good
wives, are often themselves entirely the cause of it.
When a woman is claimed at times when she takes
no <em>natural</em> pleasure in union, it reduces her vitality,
and tends to kill her power of enjoying it when the
love season returns.</p>

<p>It is certainly true of women as they have been
made by the inhibitions of modern conditions, that
most of them are only fully awake to the existence of
sex after marriage. As we are human beings, the social,
intellectual, spiritual side of the love-choice have
tended to mask the basic physiological aspect of
women's sex-life. To find a woman in whom the currents
are not all so entangled that the whole is inseparable
into factors, is not easy, but I have found
that wives (particularly happy wives whose feelings
are not complicated by the stimulus of another love)
who have been separated from their husbands for
some months through professional or business duties&mdash;whose
husbands, for instance, are abroad&mdash;are the
women from whom the best and most definitive evidence
of a fundamental rhythm of feeling can be obtained.
Such women, yearning daily for the tender
comradeship and nearness of their husbands, find, in
addition, at particular times, an accession of longing
for the close physical union of the final sex-act. Many
such separated wives feel this; and those I have asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to keep notes of the dates, have, with remarkable
unanimity, told me that these times came specially
just before and some week or so after the close of
menstruation, coming, that is, about every fortnight.
It is from such women that I got the first clue to the
knowledge of what I call the Law of Periodicity of
Recurrence of desire in women.</p>

<p>This law it is possible to represent graphically as a
curved line; a succession of crests and hollows as in
all wave-lines. Its simplest and most fundamental
expression, however, is generally immensely complicated
by other stimulations which may bring into it
diverse series of waves, or irregular wave-crests.
We have all, at some time, watched the regular ripples
of the sea breaking against a sand-bank, and noticed
that the influx of another current of water may send
a second system of waves at right angles to the first,
cutting athwart them, so that the two series of waves
pass through each other.</p>

<p>Woman is so sensitive and responsive an instrument,
and so liable in our modern civilised world to be
influenced by innumerable sets of stimuli, that it is
perhaps scarcely surprising that the deep, underlying
waves of her primitive sex-tides have been obscured,
and entangled so that their regular sequence has been
masked in the choppy turmoil of her sea, and their
existence has been largely unsuspected, and apparently
quite unstudied.</p>

<p>For some years I have been making as scientific
and detailed a study as possible of this extremely
complex problem. Owing to the frank and scientific
attitude of a number of women, and the ready and
intimate confidence of many more, I have obtained
a number of most interesting facts from which I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
it is already possible to deduce a generalisation which
is illuminating, and may be of great medical and
sociological value. A detailed statement of this will
be given in a scientific publication, but as it bears very
intimately on the subject of the present chapter, a short
and simple account of my conclusions must be given
here.</p>

<p>It is first necessary to consider several other features
of woman's life, however.</p>

<p>The obvious moon-month rhythm in woman, so
obvious that it <em>cannot</em> be overlooked, has been partially
studied in its relation to some of the ordinary
functions of her life. Experiments have been made
to show its influence on the rate of breathing, the
muscular strength, the temperature, the keenness of
sight, etc., and these results have even been brought
together and pictured in a single curved diagram supposed
to show the variability in woman's capacities
at the different times in her twenty-eight-day cycle.</p>

<p>But it brings home to one how little original work
even in this field has yet been done, that the same
identical diagram is repeated from book to book, and
in Marshall's Physiology it is "taken from Sellheim,"
in Havelock Ellis "from Von Ott," and in other
books is re-copied and attributed to still other sources,
but it is always the same old diagram.</p>

<p>This diagram is reproduced by one learned
authority after another, yet nearly every point on
which this curve is based appears to have been disputed.</p>

<p>According to this curve, woman's vitality rises
during the few days before menstruation, sinks to its
lowest ebb during menstruation and rises shortly
after, and then runs nearly level till it begins to rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
again before the next menstrual period. This simple
curve may or may not be true for woman's temperature,
muscular strength, and the other relatively
simple things which have been investigated. My
work and observations on a large number of women
all go to show that this curve does <em>not</em> represent the
waves of woman's sex-vitality.</p>

<p>The whole subject is so complex and so little
studied that it is difficult to enter upon it at all without
going into many details which may seem remote
or dull to the general reader. Even a question which
we must all have asked, and over which we have probably
pondered in vain&mdash;namely, what is menstruation?&mdash;cannot
yet be answered. To the lay mind it
would seem that this question should be answerable
at once by any doctor; but many medical men are still
far from being able to reply to it even approximately
correctly. (See also Appendix, <a href="#note_2">note 2</a>).</p>

<p>There are a good many slight variations among us,
ranging from a three to a five weeks "month," but
the majority of the women of our race have a moon-month
of twenty-eight days, once during which comes
the flow of menstruation. If we draw out a chart with
succeeding periods of twenty-eight days each, looking
on each period as a unit: When in this period is it
that a normal healthy woman feels desire or any up-welling
of her sex-tides?</p>

<p>The few statements which are made in general
medical and physiological literature on the subject of
sex feeling in women are generally very guarded and
vague. Marshall ("Physiology of Reproduction,"
p. 138), for instance, says: "The period of most
acute sexual feeling is generally just after the close of
the menstrual period." Ellis speaks of desire being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stronger before and sometimes also after menstruation,
and appears to lean to the view that it is natural
for desire to coincide with the menstrual flow.</p>

<p>After the most careful inquiries I have come to the
conclusion that the general confusion regarding this
subject is due partly to the great amount of variation
which exists between different individuals, and partly
to the fact that very few women have any idea of
taking any scientific interest in life, and partly to the
fact that the more profound, fundamental rhythm of
sex desire which I have come to the conclusion exists
or is potential in every normal woman, is covered
over or masked by the more superficial and temporary
influences due to a great variety of stimuli or inhibitions
in modern life. For the present consideration I
have tried to disentangle the profound and natural
rhythm from the more irregular surface waves.</p>

<p>The chart given opposite may assist in making
graphically clear what has been said in these last few
pages. It is compounded from a number of individual
records, and shows a fair average chart of the
rhythmic sequence of superabundance and flagging in
woman's sex-vitality. The tops of the wave-crests
come with remarkable regularity, so that there are two
wave-crests in each twenty-eight-day month. The one
comes on the two or three days just <em>before</em> menstruation,
the other after; but after menstruation has ceased
there is a nearly level interval, bringing the next wave-crest
to the two or three days which come about eight
or nine days after the close of menstruation&mdash;that is,
just round the fourteen days, or half the moon month,
since the last wave-crest. If this is put in its simplest
way, one may say that there are fortnightly periods
of desire, arranged so that one period comes always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
just <em>before</em> each menstrual flow. According to her
vitality at the time, and the general health of the
woman, the length of each desire-period, or, as we
might say, the size and complexity of each wave-crest,
depends. Sometimes for the whole of as much as, or
even more than three days, she may be ardently and
quite naturally stimulated, while at another time the
same woman, if she is tired and over-worked, may be
conscious of desire for only a few hours, or even less.</p>

</div>

<p>The effects of fatigue, city life, bad feeding, and,
indeed, of most outward circumstances may be very
marked, and may for years, or all her life, so reduce
her vitality that a woman may never have experienced
any spontaneous sex-impulse at all.</p>

<p>The effects of fatigue, which reduces the vital
energy, even in a normal, strongly sexed woman, can
be seen in the second curve opposite, where at <i>a</i> the
intermediate wave-crest is very much reduced. This
is not a generalised chart, but a detailed record of an
actual individual case.</p>

<p>Curves similar to those shown facing page <a href="#Page_33">32</a>
represent in general terms a simplified view of what
my research leads me to believe to be the normal,
spontaneous sex tide in women of our race. As one
young married woman confided to me, her longing for
bodily union with her husband, as distinct from her
longing for his daily companionship, seemed to well
up naturally like "clockwork," and this during
his long absence. But human beings vary remarkably
in every particular, and just as no two people
have the same features, so no two people would have
<em>absolutely</em> identical curves were they recorded in sufficient
detail. Many a woman is particularly conscious
of only one sex-impulse in each moon-month. Of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
women, some feel the period which comes before menstruation,
and some feel the one which follows it. In
those who generally feel only one, the second period is
sometimes felt when they are particularly well, or only
when they read exciting novels, or meet the man they
love at a time coinciding with the natural, but suppressed,
time of desire. There are a few women,
who seem to be really a little abnormal, who feel the
strongest desire actually during the menstrual flow.</p>

<p>If anyone who reads this thinks to test my view by
questioning a number of women, the result will probably
appear very conflicting, partly because it is not
often that women will tell the truth about such a
thing, and partly because in the larger number of
women either one or the other period is the more
acute and is the one they observe in themselves&mdash;if
they have observed anything. But a delicate and
more accurate investigation of such cases will often
bring to light the existence of the second crest of
vitality. Once the fundamental idea is grasped, much
that appeared obscure or of no significance becomes
plain and full of meaning. One lady doctor with
whom I discussed my view at once said that it illuminated
many observations she had made on her
patients, but had not brought together or explained.</p>

<p>There is but little evidence to be found in
scientific works on sex, but an interesting instance
is mentioned by Forel ("The Sexual Question,"
Engl. Transl. page 92) in another connection.
He says: "A married woman confessed to me,
when I reproached her for being unfaithful to
her husband, that she desired coitus at least once a
fortnight, and that when her husband was not there
she took the first comer." Forel did not see any law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in this. We may perhaps all see in her want of self-control
a grievous <em>moral</em> abnormality, but in her
fortnightly periods of desire she fits perfectly into the
physiological law which, it appears to me, governs
the normal sex tides of our race.</p>

<p>In this connection it is of interest to note the decrees
of the Mosaic Law regarding marriage intercourse.
Not only was all intercourse with a woman during
her menstruation period very heavily punished (see
Leviticus xx. 18: "If a man lie with a woman having
her sickness ... both of them shall be cut off from
among their people"), but the Mosaic Law provided
that women should be protected from intercourse for
some days <em>after</em> each such period. The results obtained
by my independent investigation thus find
some support in this ancient wisdom of the East.
Modern writers are inclined to deride the Mosaic Law
on the ground that it prohibits intercourse just at the
time when <em>they think</em> sex feeling should be strongest.
But it does not appear on what grounds they make the
latter statement, nor do they give any scientific data
in support of it. Thus Galabin in his Manual of
Midwifery says: "In the Jewish law women are
directed to abstain<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> from coitus during menstruation
and for seven days after its cessation. Strict
observers of the law are said to go beyond what is
commanded in Leviticus, and even if discharge lasts
only for an hour or two, to observe five days during
which the discharge might last, for the period itself,
and add to these seven clear days, making twelve in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
all. It is much to be doubted whether a whole
nation was ever induced to practise abstinence at the
period of most acute sexual feeling." But, as will
readily be recognised, the old Jewish plan of having
twelve clear days after the beginning of menstruation
before the next union is in almost exact harmony with
the Law of Periodicity of Recurrence of women's
desire shown in my charts, pp. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, 33.</p>

<p>These comparatively simple curves represent what I
would postulate as the normal spontaneous up-welling
of natural desire in woman. These are the foundations
on which the edifice of the physical expression of
love may be built. It must not be forgotten, however,
that, particularly in modern luxurious life, there are
innumerable excitements which may <em>stimulate</em> sexual
feeling, just as there are many factors in our life which
tend to inhibit or retard it. A woman may be, like a
man, so swayed by a great love that there is not a day
in the whole month when her lover's touch, his voice,
the memory of his smile, does not stir her into the
thrilling longing for the uttermost union. Hence it
is often difficult, particularly for a woman dwelling
with the man she loves, to recognise this rhythm in
herself, for she may be perpetually stimulated by her
love and by his being.</p>

<p>I am convinced, however, that ordinarily, whether
she recognises it by outward signs or not, a fortnightly
rhythm profoundly influences the average woman, and
hence that it fundamentally affects the marriage relation
in every way. The burning magnificence of an
overpowering life-long love is not given to many, and
a husband who desires lasting and mutual happiness
in his marriage will carefully study his wife, observe
how far she has a normal rhythm, and in what she has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
little personal traits. He will then endeavour to adapt
his demands on her so that they are in harmony with
her nature.</p>

<p>This mutual adaptation is not an entirely simple
matter, and will be considered in the next chapter.</p>

<h2>Chapter V.</h2>

<h3>Mutual Adjustment</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Love worketh no ill to his neighbour."&mdash;St. Paul.</p></blockquote>


<p>In the average man of our race desire knows no
season beyond the slight slackening of the winter
months and the heightening of spring. Some men
have observed in themselves a faintly-marked
monthly rhythm; but in the majority of men desire,
even if held in stern check, is merely slumbering. It
is always present, ever ready to wake at the lightest
call, and often so spontaneously insistent as to require
perpetual conscious repression.</p>

<p>It would go ill with the men of our race had
women retained the wild animals' infrequent seasonal
rhythm, and with it her inviolable rights in her own
body save at the mating season. Woman, too, has
acquired a much more frequent rhythm; but, as it
does not equal man's, he has tended to ignore and
over-ride it, coercing her at all times and seasons,
either by force, or by the even more compelling power
of "divine" authority and social tradition.</p>

<p>If man's desire is perpetual and woman's intermittent;
if man's desire naturally wells up every day
or every few days, and woman's only every fortnight
or every month, it may appear at first sight impossible
for the unwarped needs of both natures simultaneously
to be satisfied.</p>

<p>The sense that a satisfactory mutual adjustment
is not within the realms of possibility has, indeed, obsessed
our race for centuries. The result has been
that the supposed need of one of the partners has
tended to become paramount, and we have established
the social traditions of a husband's "rights"
and wifely "duty." As one man quite frankly said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to me: "As things are it is impossible for both sexes
to get what they want. One <em>must</em> be sacrificed. And
it is better for society that it should be the woman."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the men who consciously sacrifice the
women are in a minority. Most men act in ignorance.
Our code, however, has blindly sacrificed not only the
woman, but with her the happiness of the majority
of men, who, in total ignorance of its meaning and
results, have grown up thinking that women should
submit to regularly frequent, or even nightly, intercourse.
For the sake of a few moments of physical
pleasure they lose realms of ever-expanding joy and
tenderness; and while men and women may not realise
the existence of an untrodden paradise, they both
suffer, if only half consciously, from being shut out
from it.</p>

<p>Before making some suggestions which may help
married people to find not only a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i> of mutual
endurance, but a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via perfecta</i> of mutual joy, it is
necessary to consider a few points about the actual
nature of man's "desire." In the innumerable books
addressed to the young which I have read, I have not
found one which gives certain points regarding the
meaning of the male sex-phenomena which must be
grasped before it is possible to give rational guidance
to intelligent young men. The general ground plan
of our physiology is told to us in youth because it
so obviously is right for us to know it accurately and
in a clean scientific way, rather than to be perpetually
perplexed by fantastic imaginings. But the physiology
of our most profoundly disturbing functions is
ignored&mdash;in my opinion, criminally ignored. To describe
the essentials, simple, direct and scientific
language is necessary, though it may surprise those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
who are accustomed only to the hazy vagueness which
has led to so much misapprehension of the truth.
Every mating man and woman should know the following: The
sex organs of a man consist not only
of the tissues which give rise to the living, moving,
ciliated cells, the <em>sperms</em>, and of the penis through
which they pass and by means of which they are
directed into the proper place for their deposition, the
woman's vagina. Associated with these primary and
essential structures there are other tissues and glands
which have numerous subsidiary but yet very important
parts to play; some of which influence almost
every organ in the body. Man's penis, when unstimulated,
is soft, small and drooping. But when stimulated,
either by physical touch which acts through
the nerves and muscles directly, or indirectly through
messages from the brain, it increases greatly in size,
and becomes stiff, turgid and erect. Many men
imagine that the turgid condition of an erection is
due to the local accumulation of sperms, and that
these can only be naturally got rid of by an ejaculation.
This is entirely wrong. The enlargement of
the penis is not at all due to the presence of actual
sperm, but is due to the effects of the nervous reaction
on the blood-vessels, leading to the filling, principally
of the <em>veins</em>, and much less of the arteries. As the
blood enters but does not leave the penis, the venous
cavities in it fill up with venous blood until the whole
is rigid. When rigid this organ is able to penetrate
the female entrance, and there the further stimulation
of contact calls out the sperms from their storehouses,
the seminal vesicles, and they pass down the
channel (the urethra) and are expelled. If this is
clear, it will be realised that the stiffening and erection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
does not <em>necessarily</em> call for relief in the ejaculation
of sperm. If the veins can empty themselves, as
they naturally do when the nervous excitement which
restricted them locally passes, the erection will subside
without any loss of sperms, by the mere passing
back of the locally excessive blood into the ordinary
circulatory system. This can happen quite naturally
and healthily when the nerves are soothed, either
physically or as a result of a sense of mental peace
and exaltation. When, on the other hand, the local excitement
culminates in the calling up and expulsion
of the sperms, after it has once started the ejaculation
becomes quite involuntary and the sperms and the
secretions associated with them pass out of the system
and are entirely lost.</p>

<p>Of what does this loss consist? It is estimated
that there are somewhere between two and five
hundred million sperms in a single average ejaculation.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Each single one of these (in healthy men) is
capable of fertilising a woman's egg-cell and giving
rise to a new human being. (Thus by a single ejaculation
one man might fertilise nearly all the marriageable
women in the world!) Each single one of those
minute sperms carries countless hereditary traits, and
each consists very largely of nuclear plasm&mdash;the most
highly-specialised and richest substance in our bodies.
It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the analysis
of the chemical nature of the ejaculated fluid reveals
among other things a remarkably high percentage of
calcium and phosphoric acid&mdash;both precious substances
in our organisation.</p>

<p>It is therefore the greatest mistake to imagine that
the semen is something to be got rid of <em>frequently</em>&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the vital energy and the precious chemical substances
which go to its composition can be better
utilised by being transformed into other creative work
on most days of the month. And so mystic and
wonderful are the chemical transformations going on
in our bodies that the brain can often set this alchemy
in motion, particularly if the brain is helped by <em>knowledge</em>.
A strong will can often calm the nerves which
regulate the blood supply, and order the distended
veins of the penis to retract and subside without
wasting the semen in an ejaculation.</p>

<p>But while it is good that a man should be able to
do this often, it is not good to try to do it always.
The very restraint which adds to a man's strength up
to a point, taxes his strength when carried beyond it.
It is my belief that just sufficient restraint to carry
him through the ebb-tides of his wife's sex-rhythm is
usually the right amount to give the best strength,
vigour, and joy to a man if both are normal people.
If the wife has, as I think the majority of healthy,
well-fed young women will be found to have, a fortnightly
consciousness or unconscious <em>potentiality</em> of
desire, then the two should find a perfect mutual adjustment
in having fortnightly unions; for this need
not be confined to only a single union on such occasion.
Many men, who can well practise restraint for
twelve or fourteen days, will find that one union only
will not then thoroughly satisfy them; and if they
have the good fortune to have healthy wives, they will
find that the latter, too, have the desire for several
unions in the course of a day or two. If the wave-crests
facing page 32 are studied, it will be seen that
they spread over two or three days and show several
small minor crests. This is what happens when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
woman is thoroughly well and vital; her desire recurs
during a day or two, sometimes even every few hours
if it does not, and sometimes even when it does,
receive satisfaction.</p>

<p>Expressed in general terms (which, of course, will
not fit everybody) my view may be formulated thus:
The mutually best regulation of intercourse in marriage
is to have three or four days of repeated unions,
followed by about ten days without any unions at
all, unless some strong external stimulus has stirred
a mutual desire.</p>

<p>I have been interested to discover that the people
known to me who have accidentally fixed upon this
arrangement of their lives are <em>happy</em>: and it should
be noted that it fits in with the charts I give which
represent the normal, spontaneous feeling of so many
women.</p>

<p>There are many women, however, who do not feel,
or who may not at first recognise, a second, but have
only one time of natural pleasure in sex in each moon-month.
Many men of strong will and temperate lives
will be able so to control themselves that they can
adjust themselves to this more restrained sex-life, as
do some with whom I am acquainted. On the other
hand, there will be many who find this period too
long to live through without using a larger amount
of energy in restraining their impulse than is justifiable.
It seems to me never justifiable to spend so
much energy and will power on restraining natural
impulses, that valuable work and intellectual power
and poise are made to suffer. If, then, a strongly-sexed
husband, who finds it a real loss to his powers
of work to endure through twenty-six days of abstinence,
should find himself married to a wife whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
vitality is so low that she can only take pleasure in
physical union once in her moon-month (in some it
will be before, in some a little time after, her menstrual
flow), he should note carefully the time she is
spontaneously happy in their union, and then at any
cost restrain himself through the days immediately
following, and about a fortnight after her time of
desire he should set himself ardently to woo her.
Unless she is actually out of health he is more likely
then than at any other time to succeed not only in
winning her compliance, but also in giving her the
proper feeling and attaining mutual ecstasy.</p>

<p>The husband who so restrains himself, even if it
is hard to do it, will generally find that he is a
thousand-fold repaid not only by the increasing
health and happiness of his wife, and the much intenser
pleasure he gains from their mutual intercourse,
but also by his own added vitality and sense of self-command.
A fortnight is not too long for a healthy
man to restrain himself with advantage.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Clouston says ("Before I Wed," 1913,
page 84): "Nature has so arranged matters that the
more constantly control is exercised the more easy
and effective it becomes. It becomes a habit. The less
control is exercised the greater tendency there is for
a desire to become a <em>craving</em> of an uncontrollable kind,
which is itself of the nature of disease, and means
death sooner or later." This conclusion is not only the
result of the intellectual and moral experience of our
race, but is supported by physiological experiments.</p>

<p>While a knowledge of the fundamental laws of our
being should in the main regulate our lives, so complex
are we, so sensitive to a myriad impressions, that
clock-work regularity can never rule us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Even where the woman is strongly sexed, with a
well-marked recurrence of desire, which is generally
satisfied by fortnightly unions, it may not infrequently
happen that, in between these periods, there may be
additional special occasions when there springs up a
mutual longing to unite. These will generally depend
on some event in the lovers' lives which stirs their
emotions; some memory of past passion, such as an
anniversary of their wedding, or perhaps will be due
to a novel, poem, or picture which moves them
deeply. If the man she loves plays the part of tender
wooer, even at times when her passion would not
<em>spontaneously</em> arise, a woman can generally be stirred
so fundamentally as to give a passionate return. But
at the times of her ebb-tides the stimulus will have
to be stronger than at the high tides, and it will then
generally be found that the appeal must be made even
more through her emotional and spiritual nature and
less through the physical than usual.</p>

<p>The supreme law for husbands is: Remember that
each act of union must be tenderly wooed for and
won, and that no union should ever take place unless
the woman also desires it and is made physically ready
for it. (See page <a href="#Page_47">47</a>.)</p>

<p>While in most marriages the husband has to restrain
himself to meet the wife's less frequently recurrent
rhythm, there are, on the other hand, marriages
in which the husband is so under-sexed that he
cannot have ordinary union save at very infrequent
intervals without a serious effect on his health. If
such a man is married to a woman who has inherited
an unusually strong and over-frequent desire, he may
suffer by union with her, or may cause her suffering
by refusing to unite. It is just possible that for such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
people the method of Karezza (see Dr. A. Stockham's
book "Karezza"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on the subject) might bring them
both the health and peace they need; conserving the
man's vital energy from the loss of which he suffers,
and giving the woman the sense of union and physical
nerve-soothing she requires. But the variations in the
sex-needs and the sex-ideas of different healthy people
are immense, far greater than can be suggested in this
book.</p>

<p>Ellis states that the Queen of Aragon ordained that
six times a day was the proper rule in legitimate
marriage! So abnormally sexed a woman would today
probably succeed in killing by exhaustion a succession
of husbands, for the man who could match
such a desire is rare, though perhaps less exceptional
than such a woman.</p>

<p>Though the timing and the frequency of union are
the points about which questions are oftenest asked
by the ignorant and well-meaning, and are most misunderstood,
yet there are other fundamental facts concerning
coitus about which even medical men seem
surprisingly ignorant. Regarding these, a simple
statement of the physiological facts is essential.</p>

<p>An impersonal and scientific knowledge of the
structure of our bodies is the surest safeguard against
prurient curiosity and lascivious gloating. This
knowledge at the back of the minds of the lovers,
though not perhaps remembered as such, may also
spare the unintentioned cruelty of behaviour which so
readily injures one whose lover is ignorant.</p>

<p>What actually happens in an act of union
should be known. After the preliminaries have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
mutually roused the pair, the stimulated penis,
enlarged and stiffened, is pressed into the woman's
vagina. Ordinarily when a woman is not stimulated,
the entrance to this canal, as well as the exterior lips of
soft tissue surrounding it, are dry and rather crinkled,
and the vaginal opening is smaller than the man's
distended penis. But when the woman is what is
physiologically called tumescent (that is, when she is
ready for union and has been profoundly stirred) local
parts are flushed by the internal blood supply and to
some extent are turgid like those of the man, while a
secretion of mucus lubricates the opening of the
vagina. In an ardent woman the vaginal orifice may
even spontaneously contract and relax. (So powerful
is the influence of thought upon our bodily structure,
that in some people all these physical results may be
brought about by the thought of the loved one, by
the enjoyment of tender words and kisses, and the
beautiful subtleties of wooing.) It can therefore be
readily imagined that when the man tries to enter a
woman whom he has <em>not</em> wooed to the point of stimulating
her natural physical reactions of preparation,
he is endeavouring to force his entry through a dry-walled
opening too small for it. He may thus cause
the woman actual pain, apart from the mental revolt
and loathing she is likely to feel for a man who so regardlessly
uses her. On the other hand, in the tumescent
woman the opening, already naturally prepared,
is lubricated by mucus, and all the nerves and
muscles are ready to react and easily accept the man's
entering organ. This account is of the meeting of
two who have been already married. The first union
of a virgin girl differs, of course, from all others, for
on that occasion the hymen is broken. One would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
think that every girl who was about to be married
would be told of this necessary rupturing of the membrane
and the temporary pain it would cause her; but
even still large numbers of girls are allowed to marry
in complete and cruel ignorance.</p>

<p>It should be realised that a man does not woo and
win a woman once for all when he marries her: <em>he
must woo her before every separate act of coitus</em>, for
each act corresponds to a marriage as other creatures
know it. Wild animals are not so foolish as man; a
wild animal does not unite with his female without the
wooing characteristic of his race, whether by stirring
her by a display of his strength in fighting another
male, or by exhibiting his beautiful feathers or song.
And we must not forget that the wild animals are
assisted by nature; they generally only woo just at
the season when the female is beginning to feel natural
desire. But man, who wants his mate all out of season
as well as in it, has a double duty to perform, and must
himself rouse, charm, and stimulate her to the local
readiness which would have been to some extent
naturally prepared for him had he waited till her own
desire welled up.</p>

<p>To render a woman ready before uniting with her
is not only the merest act of humanity to save her
pain, but is of value from the man's point of view,
for (unless he is one of those relatively few abnormal
and diseased variants who delight only in rape) the
man gains an immense increase of sensation from the
mutuality thus attained, and the health of both the
man and the woman is most beneficially affected.</p>

<p>Assuming now that the two are in the closest mental
and spiritual, as well as sensory harmony: in what
position should the act be consummated? Men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
women, looking into each other's eyes, kissing
tenderly on the mouth, with their arms round each
other, meet face to face. And that position is symbolic
of the coming together of the two who meet together
gladly.</p>

<p>It seems incredible that to-day educated men should
be found who&mdash;apparently on theological grounds&mdash;refuse
to countenance any other position. Yet one wife
told me that she was crushed and nearly suffocated by
her husband, so that it took her hours to recover after
each union, but that "on principle" he refused to
attempt any other position than the one he chose to
consider normal. Mutual well-being should be the
guide for each pair. (See Addition, p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>.)</p>

<p>It is perhaps not generally realised how great are
the variations of size, shape, and position of all the sex
parts of the body in different individuals, yet they
differ more even than the size and characters of all the
features of the face and hands. It happens, therefore,
that the position which suits most people is unsatisfactory
for others. Some, for instance, can only
benefit by union when both are lying on their sides.
Though medically this is generally considered unfavourable
or prohibitive for conception, yet I know
women who have had several children and whose
husbands always used this position. In this matter
every couple should find out for themselves which of
the many possible positions best suits them <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>When the two have met and united, the usual
result is that, after a longer or shorter interval, the
man's mental and physical stimulation reaches a
climax in sensory intoxication and in the ejaculation
of semen. Where the two are perfectly adjusted, the
woman simultaneously reaches the crisis of nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and muscular reactions very similar to his. This
mutual orgasm is extremely important (see also p.
<a href="#Page_58">58</a>), but in many cases the man's climax comes so
swiftly that the woman's reactions are not nearly
ready, and she is left without it. Though in some
instances the woman may have one or more crises
before the man achieves his, it is, perhaps, hardly an
exaggeration to say that 70 or 80 per cent. of our
married women (in the middle classes) are deprived
of the full orgasm through the excessive speed of the
husband's reactions, or through some mal-adjustment
of the relative shapes and positions of the organs. So
deep-seated, so profound, are woman's complex sex-instincts
as well as her organs, that in rousing them
the man is rousing her whole body and soul. And
this takes time. More time, indeed, than the average,
uninstructed husband gives to it. Yet woman has at
the surface a small vestigial organ called the clitoris,
which corresponds morphologically to the man's penis,
and which, like it, is extremely sensitive to touch-sensations.
This little crest, which lies anteriorly
between the inner lips round the vagina, enlarges
when the woman is really tumescent, and by the stimulation
of movement it is intensely roused and transmits
this stimulus to every nerve in her body. But
even after a woman's dormant sex-feeling is aroused
and all the complex reactions of her being have been
set in motion, it may even take as much as from ten
to twenty minutes of actual physical union to consummate
her feeling, while two or three minutes often
completes the union for a man who is ignorant of
the need to control his reactions so that both may
experience the added benefit of a mutual crisis to
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of well-meaning people demand from
men absolute "continence" save for procreation
only. They overlook the innumerable physiological
reactions concerned in the act, as well as the subtle
spiritual alchemy of it, and propound the view that
"the opposition to continence, save for procreation
only, has but one argument to put forward, and that
is appetite, selfishness." (<cite>The Way of God in
Marriage.</cite>)</p>

<p>I maintain, however, that it should be realised that
the complete act of union is a triple consummation.
It symbolises, and at the same time actually enhances,
the spiritual union; there are a myriad subtleties of
soul-structures which are compounded in this alchemy.
At the same time the act gives the most intense
physical pleasure and benefit which the body can experience,
and it is a <em>mutual</em>, not a selfish, pleasure and
profit, more calculated than anything else to draw out
an unspeakable tenderness and understanding in both
partakers of this sacrament; while, thirdly, it is the
act which gives rise to a new life by rendering possible
the fusion of one of the innumerable male sperms
with the female egg-cell.</p>

<p>It often happens nowadays that, dreading the expense
and the physical strain of child-bearing for his
wife, the husband practises what is called <i>coitus interruptus</i>&mdash;that
is, he withdraws just before the ejaculation,
but when he is already so stimulated that the
ejaculation has become involuntary. In this way the
semen is spent, but, as it does not enter the wife's
body, fertilisation and, consequently, procreation cannot
take place. This practice, while it may have saved
the woman the anguish of bearing unwanted children,
is yet very harmful to her, and is to be deprecated. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
tends to leave the woman in "mid-air" as it were;
to leave her stimulated and unsatisfied, and therefore
it has a very bad effect on her nerves and general
health, particularly if it is done frequently. The
woman, too, loses the advantage (and I am convinced
that it is difficult to overstate the physiological advantage)
of the partial absorption of the man's secretions,
which must take place through the large tract of
internal epithelium with which they come in contact.
If, as physiology has already proved is the case, the
internal absorption of secretions from the sex organs
plays so large a part in determining the health and
character of remote parts of the body, it is extremely
likely that the highly stimulating secretion of man's
semen can and does penetrate and affect the woman's
whole organism. Actual experiment has shown that
iodine placed in the vagina in solution is so quickly
absorbed by the epithelial walls that in an hour it has
penetrated the system and is even being excreted. It
still remains, however, for scientific experiments to
be devised which will enable us to study the effects of
the absorption of substances from the semen. On
the other hand, <i>coitus interruptus</i> is not always harmful
for the man, for he has the complete sex-act, though
a good many men think its effects on them are undesirable,
and it may lead to lack of desire or even
impotence toward his wife in a man who practises it
with her, or, on the other hand, to a too swift fresh
desire from the lack of complete resolution of nervous
tension. It is certainly bad when its safety from consequences
induces him to frequent indulgence, for
thus wastefully to scatter what should be <em>creative
power</em> is to reduce his own vitality and power of work
(see also page <a href="#Page_41">41</a>). By those who have a high appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the value of their creative impulse, and who
wish to know the mutual pleasure and enhancement of
sex-union without wasting it, this method should not
be practised.</p>

<p>It should never be forgotten that without the discipline
of control there is no lasting delight in erotic
feeling. The fullest delight, even in a purely physical
sense, can <em>only</em> be attained by those who curb and
direct their natural impulses.</p>

<p>Dr. Saleeby's words are appropriate in this connection
(Introduction to Forel's "Sexual Ethics," 1908):
"Professor Forel speaks of subduing the sexual
instinct. I would rather speak of transmuting it. The
direct method of attack is often futile, always necessitous
of effort, but it is possible for us to transmute
our sex-energy into higher forms in our individual
lives, thus justifying the evolutionary and physiological
contention that it is the source of the higher
activities of man, of moral indignation, and of the
'restless energy' which has changed the surface of
the earth."</p>

<p>Forel says ("The Sexual Question," 1908):
"Before engaging in a life-long union, a man and
woman ought to explain to each other their sexual feelings
so as to avoid deception and incompatibility later
on." This would be admirable advice were it possible
for a virgin girl to know much about the reactions and
effects upon her mind and body of the act of coitus,
but she does not. Actually it often takes several years
for eager and intelligent couples fully to probe themselves
and to discover the extent and meaning of the
immensely profound physiological and spiritual results
of marriage. Yet it is true that a noble frankness
would save much misery when, as happens not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
infrequently, one or other of the pair marry with the
secret determination to have no children.</p>

<p>So various are we all as individuals, so complex all
the reactions and inter-actions of sex relations, that
no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down. Each couple,
after marriage, must study themselves, and the lover
and the beloved must do what best serves them both
and gives them the highest degree of mutual joy and
power. There are, however, some laws which should
be inviolable. Their details can be gathered from the
preceding pages, and they are summed up in the
words: "Love worketh no ill to the beloved."</p>

<h2>Chapter VI.</h2>

<h3>Sleep</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">He giveth His Beloved Sleep.</p></blockquote>


<p>The healing magic of sleep is known to all.
Sleeplessness is a punishment for so many
different violations of nature's laws, that it is
perhaps one of the most prevalent of humanity's innumerable
sufferings. While most of the aspects of
sleep and sleeplessness have received much attention
from specialists in human physiology, the relation between
sleep and coitus appears to be but little realised.
Yet there is an intimate, profound and quite direct relation
between the power to sleep, naturally and refreshingly,
and the harmonious relief of the whole
system in the perfected sex-act.</p>

<p>We see this very clearly in ordinary healthy
man. If, for some reason, he has to live unsatisfied
for some time after the acute stirring of his
longing for physical contact with his wife, he tends
in the interval to be wakeful, restless, and his nerves
are on edge.</p>

<p>Then, when the propitious hour arrives, and after
the love-play, the growing passion expands, until the
transports of feeling find their ending in the explosive
completion of the act, at once the tension of his whole
system relaxes, and his muscles fall into gentle, easy
attitudes of languorous content, and in a few moments
the man is sleeping like a child.</p>

<p>This excellent and refreshing sleep falls like a soft
curtain of oblivion and saves the man's consciousness
from the jar and disappointment of an anti-climax.
But not only is this sleep a restorative after the
strenuous efforts of the transport, it has peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
refreshing powers, and many men feel that after such
a sleep their whole system seems rejuvenated.</p>

<p>But how fare women in this event? When they
too have had complete satisfaction they similarly
relax and slumber.</p>

<p>But as things are to-day it is scarcely an exaggeration
to say that the majority of wives are left wakeful
and nerve-racked to watch with tender motherly
brooding, or with bitter and jealous envy, the
slumbers of the men who, through ignorance and
carelessness, have neglected to see that they too had
the necessary resolution of nervous tension.</p>

<p>Many married women have told me that after they
have had relations with their husbands they are restless,
either for some hours or for the whole night;
and I feel sure that the prevalent failure on the part
of many men to effect orgasms for their wives at each
congress, must be a very common source of the sleeplessness
and nervous diseases of so many married
women.</p>

<p>The relation between the completion of the sex
act and sleep in woman is well indicated in the case
of Mrs. A., who is typical of a large class of wives.
She married a man with whom she was passionately
in love. Neither she nor her husband had ever had
connection with anyone else, and, while they were
both keen and intelligent people with some knowledge
of biology, neither knew anything of the details
of human sex union. For several years her
husband had unions with her which gave him some
satisfaction and left him ready at once to sleep.
Neither he nor she knew that women should have an
orgasm, and after every union she was left so "on
edge" and sleepless that never less than several hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
would elapse before she could sleep at all, and often
she remained wakeful the whole night.</p>

<p>After her husband's death her health improved,
and in a year or two she entered into a new relation
with a man who was aware of women's needs and
spent sufficient time and attention to them to ensure
a successful completion for her as well as for himself.
The result was that she soon became a good sleeper,
with the attendant benefits of restored nerves and
health.</p>

<p>Sleep is so complex a process, and sleeplessness
the resultant of so many different maladjustments,
that it is, of course, possible that the woman may
sleep well enough, even if she be deprived of the
relief and pleasure of perfect union. But in so many
married women sleeplessness and a consequent
nervous condition are coupled with a lack of the
complete sex relation, that one of the first questions a
physician <em>should</em> put to those of his women patients
who are worn and sleepless is: Whether her husband
really fulfils his marital duty in their physical relation.</p>

<p>From their published statements, and their admissions
to me, it appears that many practising doctors
are either almost unaware of the very existence of
orgasm in women, or look upon it as a superfluous
and accidental phenomenon. Yet to have had a
moderate number of orgasms at some time at least
is a necessity for the full development of a woman's
health and all her powers.</p>

<p>As this book is written for those who are married,
I say nothing here about the lives of those who are
still unmarried, though, particularly after the age of
thirty has been reached, they may be very difficult
and need much study and consideration. It is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
worth noticing how prevalent sleeplessness is
among a class of women who have never had
any normal sex-life or allowed any relief to their
desires. There is little doubt that the complete lack
of a normal sex relation is one of the several factors
which render many middle-aged unmarried women
nervous and sleepless.</p>

<p>Yet for the unmarried woman the lack is not so
acute nor so localised as it is for the married woman
who is thwarted in the natural completion of her sex-functions
after they have been directly stimulated.</p>

<p>The unmarried woman, unless she be in love with
some particular man, has no definite stimulus to her
sex desires beyond the natural upwelling of the creative
force. The married woman, however, is not only
diffusely stirred by the presence of the man she loves,
but is also acutely locally and physically stimulated
by his relation with her. And if she is then left in
mid-air, without natural relief to her tension, she is
in this respect far worse off than the unmarried
woman.</p>

<p>When a wife is left sleepless through the neglect
of the mate who slumbers healthily by her side, it is
not surprising if she spends the long hours reviewing
their mutual position; and the review cannot yield
her much pleasure or satisfaction. For, deprived of the
physical delight of mutual orgasm (though, perhaps,
like so many wives, quite unconscious of all it can
give), she sees in the sex act an arrangement where
pleasure, relief and subsequent sleep, are all on her
husband's side, while she is merely the passive instrument
of his enjoyment. Nay, more than that: if following
every union she has long hours of wakefulness,
she then sees clearly the encroachment on her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
health in an arrangement in which she is not merely
passive, but is actively abused.</p>

<p>Another of the consequences of the incomplete relation
is that often, stirred to a point of wakefulness
and vivacity by the preliminary sex-stimulation (of
the full meaning of which she may be unconscious), a
romantic and thoughtful woman is then most able to
talk intimately and tenderly&mdash;to speak of the things
<em>most</em> near and sacred to her heart. And she may then
be terribly wounded by the inattention of her husband,
which, coming so soon after his ardent demonstrations
of affection, appears peculiarly callous. It
makes him appear to her to be indifferent to the
highest side of marriage&mdash;the spiritual and romantic
intercourse. Thus she may see in the man going off
to sleep in the midst of her love-talk, a gross and inattentive
brute&mdash;and all because she has never shared
the climax of his physical tension, and does not know
that its natural reaction is sleep.</p>

<p>These thoughts are so depressing even to the
tenderest and most loving woman, and so bitter to one
who has other causes of complaint, that in their turn
they act on the whole system and increase the damage
done by the mere sleeplessness.</p>

<p>The older school of physiologists dealt in methods
too crude to realise the physiological results of our
thoughts, but it is now well known that anger and
bitterness have experimentally recognisable physiological
effects, and are injurious to the whole system.</p>

<p>It requires little imagination to see that after
months or years of such embittered sleeplessness, the
woman tends not only to become neurasthenic but
also resentful towards her husband. She is probably
too ignorant and unobservant of her own physiology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to realise the full meaning of what is taking place,
but she feels vaguely that he is to blame, and that she
is being sacrificed for what, in her still greater ignorance
of <em>his</em> physiology, seems to her to be his mere
pleasure and self-indulgence.</p>

<p>He, with his health maintained by the natural outlet
followed by recuperative sleep, is not likely to be
ready to look into the gloomy and shadowy land of
vague reproach and inexplicable trivial wrongs which
are all the expression she gives to her unformulated
physical grievance. So he is likely to set down any
resentment she may show to "nerves" or "captiousness";
and to be first solicitous, and then impatient,
towards her apparently irrelevant complaints.</p>

<p>If he is, as many men are, tender and considerate,
he may try to remedy matters by restricting to the
extreme limit of what is absolutely necessary for him,
the number of times they come together. Unconsciously
he thus only makes matters worse; for as a
general rule, he is quite unaware of his wife's rhythm,
and does not arrange to coincide with it in his infrequent
tender embraces. As he is now probably sleeping
in another room and not daring to come for the
nightly talks and tenderness which are so sweet a
privilege of marriage, here, as in other ways, his well-meaning
but wrongly-conceived efforts at restraint
only tend to drive the pair still further apart.</p>

<p>To make plain the reasonableness of my view regarding
sleep, it is necessary to mention some of the
immensely profound influences which it is now known
that sex exerts, even when not stimulated to its specific
use.</p>

<p>In those who are deprived of their sex-organs, particularly
when young, many of the other features and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
organs of the body develop abnormally or fail to
appear. Castrated boys (eunuchs) when grown up,
tend to have little or no beard, or moustache, to have
high-pitched voices and several other characters which
separate them from normal men.</p>

<p>The growth of organs and structures so remote
from the sex-organs, as, e.g., the larynx, have been
found to be influenced by the chemical stimulus of
secretions from the sex-organs and their subsidiary
glands. These secretions are not passed out through
external ducts but enter the blood system <em>directly</em>.
Such secretions passing straight from the ductless
glands into the vascular system are of very great importance
in almost all our bodily functions. They
have recently been much studied, and the general
name of <em>Hormones</em> given to them by Starling.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
idea that some particular secretions or "humours"
are connected with each of the internal organs of the
body, is a very ancient one; but we have even yet only
the vaguest and most elementary knowledge of a few
of the many miracles performed by these subtle
chemical substances. Thus we know that the stimulus
of food in the stomach sends a chemical substance
from one ductless gland in the digestive system
chasing through the blood to another gland which
prepares a different digestive secretion further on.
We know that the thyroid gland in the neck swells
and contracts in very sensitive relation with the sex
organs; we know that some chemical secretion from
the developing embryo, or the tissue in which it
grows, sends its chemical stimulus to the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mammary glands of the mother; we know that if the
ovaries of a girl or the testes of a boy are completely
cut out, the far-reaching influences their hormones
would have exerted are made evident by the numerous
changes in the system and departures from the normal,
which result from their lack.</p>

<p>But we do <em>not</em> know, for physiologists have not yet
studied the degree and character of the immense
stimulus of sex-life and experience on the glands of
the sex-organs, or how they affect the whole of the
human being's life and powers.</p>

<p>The "Mendelians" and the "Mutationists," who
both tend to lay so much (and I think such undue)
stress on morphological hereditary factors, seem at
present to have the ear of the public more than the
physiologists. But it is most important that every
grown up man and woman should know that through
the various chemical substances or "messengers"
(which Starling called the hormones) there is an extremely
rapid, almost immediate, effect on the activities
of organs in remote parts of the body, due to the
influences exerted on one or other internal organ.</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that any influences exerted on
such profoundly important organs as those connected
with sex must have far-reaching results in many
unexpected fields.</p>

<p>What must be taking place in the female system
as a result of the completed sex act?</p>

<p>It is true that in coitus woman has but a slight
external secretion, and that principally of mucus. But
we have no external signs of all the complex processes
and reactions going on in digestion and during the
production of digestive secretions. When, as is the
case in orgasm, we have such intense and apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
nervous, vascular and muscular reactions, it seems
inevitable that there must be correspondingly profound
internal correlations. Is it conceivable that
organs so fundamentally placed, and whose mere
existence we know affects the personal characters of
women, could escape physiological result from the
intense preliminary stimulus and acute sensations of
an orgasm?</p>

<p>To ask this question is surely to answer it. It is to
my mind inconceivable that the orgasm in woman
as in man should not have profound physiological
effects. Did we know enough about the subject, many
of the "nervous breakdowns" and neurotic tendencies
of the modern woman could be directly traced
to the partial stimulation of sexual intercourse without
its normal completion which is so prevalent in
modern marriage.</p>

<p>This subject, and its numerous ramifications, are
well worth the careful research of the most highly-trained
physiologists. There is nothing more profound,
or of more vital moment to modern humanity
as a whole, than is the understanding of the sex
nature and sex needs of men and women.</p>

<p>I may point out as a mere suggestion that the man's
sex-organs give rise to <em>external</em> and also to <em>internal</em>
secretions. The former only leave the glands which
secrete them as a result of definite stimulus; the latter
appear to be perpetually exuded in small quantities
and always to be entering and influencing the whole
system. In women we know there are corresponding
perpetual internal secretions, and it seems evident to
me that there must be some internal secretions which
are only released under the definite stimulus of the
whole sex-act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The English and American peoples, who lead the
world in so many ways, have an almost unprecedentedly
high proportion of married women who get
no satisfaction from physical union with their husbands,
though they bear children, and may in every
other respect appear to be happily married.</p>

<p>The modern civilised neurotic woman has become a
by-word in the Western world. Why?</p>

<p>I am certain that much of this suffering is caused
by the <em>ignorance</em> of both men and women regarding
not only the inner physiology, but even the obvious
outward expression, of the complete sex-act.</p>

<p>Many medical men now recognise that numerous
nervous and other diseases are associated with the lack
of physiological relief for natural or stimulated sex
feelings in women. Ellis<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> quotes the opinion of an
Austrian gynecologist who said that, "of every
hundred women who come to him with uterine
troubles, seventy suffer from congestion of the womb,
which he regarded as due to incomplete coitus."
While a writer in a recent number of the <cite>British
Medical Journal</cite><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> published some cases in which
quite serious nervous diseases in wives were put
right when their husbands were cured of too
hasty ejaculation.</p>

<p>Sleep, concerning which I began this chapter, is
but one of innumerable indications of inner processes
intimately bound up with the sex-reactions. When
the sex-rite is, in every sense, rightly performed, the
healing wings of sleep descend both on the man and
on the woman in his arms. Every organ in their bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is influenced and stimulated to play its part, while
their spirits, after soaring in the dizzy heights of
rapture, are wafted to oblivion, thence to return
gently to the ordinary plains of daily consciousness.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII.</h2>

<h3>Modesty and Romance</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>A person can therefore no more promise to love or not to
love than he can promise to live long. What he can promise is
to take good care of his life and of his love.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ellen Key.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>Artists clearly, and poets in veiled
language, have in all ages, expressed the
glory of the naked human body. Before the
Venus of Milo in her Paris home, even the empty-headed
and ridiculously-dressed creatures of fashion
stand for a moment with a catch in the throat and a
sense that here is something full of divine secrets.
One day, when I was doing my reverence before this
ancient goddess, drinking in strength and happiness
from the harmonies of her curves, a preposterously
corsetted doll came up to the statue, paused, and said
with tears in her voice to the man beside her:
"Hasn't she got the <em>loveliest</em> figure!"</p>

<p>If cold marble so stirs us, how much more the
warmth and vitality of living beauty! Any well-formed
young man or woman is immeasurably more
graceful when free from the clinging follies of modern
dress, while a beautiful woman's body has a supernal
loveliness at which no words short of a poetic rapture
can even hint. Our race has so long neglected the
culture of human beauty that a sad proportion of
mature men and women are unattractive; but most
young people have the elements of beauty, and to
them chiefly this book is addressed.</p>

<p>A young man or woman perfectly naked <em>cannot</em> be
tawdry. The fripperies, the jagged curves and inharmonious
lines and colours of the so-called "adornments"
are surmounted, and the naked figure stepping
from their scattered pile is seen in its utter simplicity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
How charming even the raggedest little
street urchins become when they leave their rags on
the bank and plunge into the water!</p>

<p>It is therefore not surprising that one of the innumerable
sweet impulses of love should be to reveal,
each to each, this treasure of living beauty. To give
each other the right to enter and enjoy the sight which
most of all sights in the world draws and satisfies the
artist's eyes.</p>

<p>This impulse, however, is, on the part of the
woman, swayed by two at least of the natural results
of her rhythmic tides. For some time during each
month, age-long tradition that she is "unclean,"
coupled with her obvious requirements, have made
her withdraw herself from even her husband's gaze.
But, on the other hand, there regularly come times
when her body is raised to a higher point of loveliness
than usual by the rounding and extra fullness of the
breasts. (This is one of the regular physiological results
of the rhythmic processes going on within her.)
Partly or wholly unconscious of the brilliance and
full perfection of her beauty, she yet delights in its
gentle promptings to reveal itself to her lover's eyes
when he adores. This innocent, this goddess-like self-confidence
retreats when the natural ebb of her vitality
returns.</p>

<p>How fortunate for man when these sweet changes
in his lover are not coerced into uniformity! For
man has still so much of the ancient hunter in his
blood that beauty which is always at hand and ever
upon its pedestal must inevitably attract him far less
than the elusive and changing charms of rhythmic
life. In the highly-evolved and cultivated woman,
who has wisdom enough not to restrict, but to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
full play to the great rhythms of her being, man's
polygamous instinct can be satisfied and charmed by
the ever-changing aspects of herself which naturally
come uppermost. And one of her natural phases is
at times to retreat, to experience a profound sex indifference,
and passionately to resent any encroachment
on her solitude.</p>

<p>This is something woman too often forgets. She
has been so thoroughly "domesticated" by man that
she feels too readily that after marriage she is all his.
And by her very docility to his perpetual demands
she destroys for him the elation, the palpitating thrills
and surprises, of the chase.</p>

<p>In the rather trivial terms of our sordid modern
life, it works out in many marriages somewhat as
follows: The married pair share a bedroom, and so
it comes about that the two are together not only at
the times of delight and interest in each other, but
during most of the unlovely and even ridiculous proceedings
of the toilet. Now it may enchant a man
once&mdash;perhaps even twice&mdash;or at long intervals&mdash;to
watch his goddess screw her hair up into a tight and
unbecoming knot and soap her ears. But it is inherently
too unlovely a proceeding to retain indefinite
enchantment. To see a beautiful woman floating in
the deep, clear water of her bath&mdash;that may enchant
for ever, for it is so lovely, but the unbeautiful
trivialities essential to the daily toilet tend only to
blur the picture and to dull the interest and attention
that should be bestowed on the body of the loved one.
Hence, ultimately, everyday association in the
commonplace daily necessities tends to reduce the
keen pleasure each takes in the other. And hence,
inevitably and tragically, though stealthily and unperceived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to reduce the keenness of stimulation the
pair exert on each other, and thus to lower their intensity
of the consummation of the sex act, and hence
to lower its physiological value.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In short, the overcoming of her personal modesty,
which is generally looked on as an essential result in
marriage where the woman becomes wholly the man's,
has generated among our women a tradition that
before their husbands they can perform any and all
of the details of personal and domestic duties. Correspondingly,
they allow the man to be neglectful of
preserving some reticence before them. This mutual
possession of the lower and more elementary experiences
of life has been, in innumerable marriages, a
factor in destroying the mutual possession of life's
higher and more poetic charms.</p>

<p>And woman's beauty wanes too often more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
through neglect than through age. The man, with
the radiant picture of his bride blurred by the daily
less lovely aspects, may cease to remind her by acts of
courtship that her body is precious. But many men
by whom each aspect of their wives is noted, are often
hurt by woman's stupidity or neglect of herself.
Women lose their grace of motion by relying on artificial
bones and stiffenings, and clog their movements
with heavy and absurdly fashioned garments. They
forget how immeasurably they can control not only
their clothed appearance but the very structure of
their bodies by the things they eat and do, by the very
thoughts they think.</p>

<p>A wise man once said that a woman deserved no
credit for her beauty at sixteen, but beauty at sixty
was her own soul's doing. I would that all the world
so thirsted for beauty that we moulded the whole race
into as lovely forms as the Greeks created.</p>

<p>In this respect I am inclined to think that man
suffers more than woman. For man is still essentially
the hunter, the one who experiences the desires and
thrills of the chase, and dreams ever of coming unawares
upon Diana in the woodlands. On the other
hand, the married woman, having once yielded all,
tends to remain passively in the man's companionship.</p>

<p>Though it may appear trivial beside the profound
physiological factors considered in recent chapters,
I think that, in the interests of husbands, an important
piece of advice to wives is: Be always escaping.
Escape the lower, the trivial, the sordid. So far as
possible (and this is far more possible than appears at
first, and requires only a little care and rearrangement
in the habits of the household) ensure that you
allow your husband to come upon you only when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
there is delight in the meeting. Whenever the
finances allow, the husband and wife should have
separate bedrooms. No soul can grow to its full
stature without spells of solitude. A married
woman's body and soul should be essentially her own,
and that can only be so if she has an inviolable retreat.
But at the same time the custom of having separate
rooms should not mean, as it often does, that the
husband only comes to his wife's room when he has
some demand to make upon her. Nothing is more
calculated to inhibit all desire for union in a sensitive
wife than the knowledge of what her husband wants
when he comes, however lovingly, to her side. Every
night, unless something prevents, there should be
the tender companionship and whispered intimacies
which are, to many people, only possible in the dark.
The "good-night" should be a time of delightful
forgetting of the outward scars of the years, and a
warm, tender, perhaps playful exchange of confidences.
This is not incompatible with what has been
said in the previous chapters, and when this custom is
maintained it overcomes the objection some people
make to separate rooms as a source of estrangements.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII.</h2>

<h3>Abstinence</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>How intoxicating indeed, how penetrating&mdash;like a most
precious wine&mdash;is that love which is the sexual transformed by
the magic of the will into the emotional and spiritual! And
what a loss on the merest grounds of prudence and the economy
of pleasure is its unbridled waste along physical channels! So
nothing is so much to be dreaded between lovers as just this&mdash;the
vulgarisation of love&mdash;and this is the rock upon which marriage
so often splits.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edward Carpenter.</span></p></blockquote>


<p>And because marriage so often splits upon this
rock, or because men and women have in all
ages yearned for spiritual beauty, there have
been those who shut themselves off from all the sweet
usages of the body. In the struggle of man to gain
command over his body, and in the slow and often
backsliding evolution of the higher love, there is no
doubt that humanity owes much to the ascetic. But
this debt is in the past. We are now gaining control
of the lower forces, we are winning knowledge of the
complex meanings and the spiritual transformations
of our physical reactions, and in the <em>future</em> the highest
social unit will be recognised to be the pair, fused in
love so that all human potentialities are theirs, as well
as the higher potentialities which only perfect love can
originate.</p>

<p>Yet, as we live to-day, with still so many remnants
of the older standards within and upon us, we must
endeavour to understand the ascetic. He (less often
she) is by no means seldom one of the products of
marriage. It not infrequently happens that after a
love-marriage and some years of what is considered
happiness, the man or woman may withdraw from the
sex life, often looking down upon it, and considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that they have reached a higher plane by so doing.
But such people seldom ask themselves if, while they
lived it, they reached the highest possible level of the
sex-life.</p>

<p>One of the most famous instances of the married
ascetic is Tolstoy, whose later opinion was that the
<em>highest</em> human being completely inhibits his sex-desires
and lives a celibate life. Ascetics, however,
seldom have much knowledge of human physiology,
and it seems to me that, with all their fine and religious
fervour, they often lack the mysticism necessary
for the full realisation of the meaning and potentialities
of the new creation resulting from man's and
woman's highest union. Doubtless if for an hour we
were to take the place of the individual chemical
atoms of Oxygen or of Hydrogen, we could have no
inkling of the physical properties of the water-drop
they together form.</p>

<p>Christianity, like most religions, had a strong wave
of asceticism early in its history. While there was, as
there still is, a harsh asceticism which is hostile to the
other sex, it is of much interest to see that there was
also a romantic asceticism which, while revolting from
the sensuality of the pagan contemporaries, did not
entirely prohibit the charms and pleasures of mutual
companionship. Thus, in a mutilated form, it seems
these early Christian ascetics gained some of the
immaterial benefits of marriage. Ellis (Vol. 6, "Sex
and Society," 1913) gives an interesting account of
these ascetic love-unions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our fathers," Chrysostom begins ("Against those who keep
Virgins in their Houses"), "only knew two forms of sexual intimacy,
marriage and fornication. Now a third form has appeared:
men introduce young girls into their houses and keep them there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
permanently, respecting their virginity. What," Chrysotom
asks, "is the reason? It seems to me that life in common with
a woman is sweet, even outside conjugal union and fleshly commerce.
That is my feeling; and perhaps it is not my feeling
alone; it may also be that of these men. They would not hold
their honour so cheap nor give rise to such scandals if this pleasure
were not violent and tyrannical.... That there should really
be a pleasure in this which produces a love more ardent than conjugal
union may surprise you at first. But when I give you the
proofs you will agree that it is so." The absence of restraint to
desire in marriage, he continues, often leads to speedy disgust, and
even apart from this, sexual intercourse, pregnancy, delivery, lactation,
the bringing up of children, and all the pains and anxieties
that accompany these things, soon destroy youth and dull the
point of pleasure. The virgin is free from these burdens. She
retains her vigour and her youthfulness, and even at the age of
forty may rival the young nubile girl. "A double ardour thus
burns in the heart of him who lives with her, and the gratification
of desire never extinguishes the bright flame which ever continues
to increase in strength." Chrysostom describes minutely
all the little cares and attentions which the modern girls of his
time required, and which these men delighted to expend on their
virginal sweethearts whether in public or in private. He cannot
help thinking, however, that the man who lavishes kisses and
caresses on a woman whose virginity he retains is putting himself
somewhat in the position of Tantalus. But this new refinement
of tender chastity, which came as a delicious discovery to the early
Christians who resolutely thrust away the licentiousness of the
pagan world, was deeply rooted, as we discover from the frequency
with which the grave Fathers of the Church, apprehensive
of scandal, felt called upon to reprove it, though their condemnation
is sometimes not without a trace of secret sympathy.</p>

<p>Thus Jerome, in his letter to Eustochium, refers to those
couples who "share the same room," often even the same bed,
and call us suspicious if we draw any conclusions; while Cyprian
(<cite>Epistola</cite>, 86) is unable to approve of those men he hears of, one
a deacon, who live in familiar intercourse with virgins, even
sleeping in the same bed with them, for, he declares, the feminine
sex is weak and youth is wanton.</p></blockquote>

<p>The harsh ascetic, however, is the one the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
ascetic most generally conjures up. Even if he accomplishes
miracles of self-restraint, and subdues desire,
he is often weakened rather than strengthened by
his determination to flout nature. Save only in the
truly great, there is a warping and narrowing which
results from coercing beyond the limits of reason the
desires which were implanted in Adam and Eve when
they were told to be fruitful and multiply.</p>

<p>As Ellen Key says ("Love and Marriage"):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Those ascetics who recommend only self-control as a remedy
for the mastery of sexual instinct, even when such control
becomes merely obstructive to life, are like the physician who
tried only to drive the fever out of his patient: it was nothing
to him that the sick man died of the cure.</p>

<p>But these ascetics may have arrived at their fanaticism by two
different paths. One group&mdash;which includes most of the female
ascetics&mdash;hates Cupid because he has never shown to them any
favour. The other group&mdash;embracing the majority of male
ascetics&mdash;curse him because he never leaves them in peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Approaching the subject in a more modern and
scientific attitude of impartial inquiry, the medical
man can produce an imposing list of diseases more or
less directly caused by abstinence both in men and
in women. These diseases range from neuralgia and
"nerves" to (in women) fibroid growths. And it is
well worthy of remark that these diseases may be
present when the patient (as have many unmarried
women) has no idea that the sex-impulse exists unmastered.</p>

<p>Thus the ascetic and the profligate (whether or not
in <em>legal</em> marriage) have both to run the gauntlet of
disease. There is, however, no disease I know of
which is caused by the normal and mutually happy
marriage relation&mdash;a relation which, certainly to most,
has positive healing and vitalising power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The profound truth which is perceived by the
ascetics is that the creative energy of sex can be <em>transformed</em>
into other activities. This truth should never
be lost sight of in marriage; where between the times
of natural, happy, and also stimulating exercise of
the sex-functions, the periods of complete abstinence
should be opportunities for transmuting the healthy
sex-power into work of every sort.</p>

</p>


<p>The Mystic in his moment of enlightenment
attains through the flux of his personality the
realisation of oneness with the divine forces
of the Universe.</p>

<p>To ordinary men and women, however, this
mystical ecstasy is unknown, and the ordinary human
consciousness is far more aware of its separateness
than of its oneness with the vital forces of creation.
Yet the glow of half swooning rapture in which the
mystic's whole being melts and floats in the light
of the divine force is paralleled in the rapture of
lovers.</p>

<p>When two who are mated in every respect burn
with the fire of the innumerable forces within them,
which set their bodies longing towards each other with
the desire to inter-penetrate and to encompass one
another, the fusion of joy and rapture is not purely
physical. The half swooning sense of flux which
overtakes the spirit in that eternal moment at the
apex of rapture sweeps into its flaming tides the whole
essence of the man and woman, and as it were, the heat
of the contact vapourises their consciousness so that it
fills the whole of cosmic space. For the moment they
are identified with the divine thoughts, the waves of
eternal force, which to the Mystic often appear in
terms of golden light.</p>

<p>From their mutual penetration into the realms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
supreme joy the two lovers bring back with them a
spark of that light which we call life.</p>

<p>And unto them a child is born.</p>

<p>This is the supreme purpose of nature in all her
enticing weft of complex factors luring the two lovers
into each other's arms. Only by the fusion of two can
the new human life come into being, and only by
creating a new life in this way can we hand on the torch
which lights our consciousness in the sphere of
matter.</p>

<p>This mystical and wonderful fact has never yet
found the poet to sing its full glory. But in the hearts
of all who have known true love lies the realisation of
the sacredness that is theirs when they are in the very
act of creation.</p>

<p>Were our bodies specifically organised for this
supreme purpose, two human beings would only pass
through the sacred fire of mutual fusion in order to
create a new life. But, however far our spirits have
evolved, our bodies are composed of matter which
bears the imprint of the many past phases through
which we have reached our present position. And
because in the world of the lower animals there is an
immense wastage of all the young lives created, and it
is necessary that myriads should be conceived in order
that a small number should reach maturity, so in our
bodies (specialised though they are in comparison
with the lower animals) both sexes still produce a far
larger number of germs awaiting fertilisation than can
be actually fructified and imbued with individual life.
So profoundly has the course of our history been
stamped upon us that each germ, unaware of its own
futility if it reaches maturity at an unpropitious
moment, is just as insistent in its development as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
favoured one which follows out the full natural course
of its career and gives rise to a new individual.</p>

<p>It is utterly impossible, organised as our bodies are
at present, for us to obey the dictates of theologians
and refrain from the destruction of potential life.
The germ cells of the woman, though immeasurably
less numerous than the male germ cells (the sperm)
yet develop uselessly over and over again in every
celibate as well as in every married woman. While
myriads of sperm cells are destroyed even in the process
of the act which does ensure fertilisation of the
woman by the single favoured sperm. If the theologians
really mean what they say, and demand the
voluntary effort of complete celibacy from all men,
save for the purpose of procreation, this will <em>not</em>
achieve their end of preventing the destruction of all
potential life; and the monthly loss of unfertilised
eggcell by women is beyond all the efforts of the will
to curb. Nature, not man, arranged the destruction of
potential life against which ascetic Bishops rage.</p>

<p>If, then, throughout the greater part of their lives
the germinal cells of both sexes inevitably disintegrate
without creating an embryo, there can be nothing
wrong in selecting the most favourable moment possible
for the conception of the first of these germinal
cells to be endowed with the supreme privilege of
creating a new life.</p>

<p>What generally happens in marriage where this is
not thought of is that one of the very earliest unions
results in the fertilisation of the wife, so that the
young pair have a baby nine months, or a little more,
after marriage.</p>

<p>Whereas, were they wise and did they realise the
full significance of what they were doing, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
allow at least six months or a year to elapse before
beginning the supreme task of their lives, the burden
of which falls mainly upon the woman.</p>

<p>For many reasons it is more ideal to have the
children spontaneously and early; but if economic
conditions are hard, as they so often are in "civilised"
life, it may be better to marry and defer the children
rather than not to marry. (See my "Wise Parenthood.")</p>

<p>If the pair married very young, and before they
could afford to support children, they might wait
several years with advantage. An exceptional case is
one of the happiest marriages I know. The pair
married while they were young students in the
University, and fourteen years later they had their
first child, a splendidly healthy boy. Though such a
long interval is certainly not to be universally recommended,
as it is said that it may result in sterility, in
this instance it was triumphantly better for the two to
have lived normally satisfied happy lives than to have
waited for fourteen years and risked the man's "fall."</p>

<p>There are many reasons, both for their own and for
the child's sake, why the potential parents should
take the wise precaution of delay, unless owing to
special circumstances they cannot expect to live together
uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>The child, conceived in rapture and hope, should be
given every material chance which the wisdom and
love of the parents can devise. And the first and
<em>most</em> vital condition of its health is that the mother
should be well and happy and free from anxiety while
she bears it.</p>

<p>The tremendous and far-reaching effects of
marriage on the woman's whole organism make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
less fitted to bear a child at the very commencement
of marriage than later on, when the system will have
adjusted itself to its new conditions.</p>

<p>Not only for the sake of the child, however, should
the first conception be a little delayed, but also to
secure the lasting happiness of the married lovers.
It is generally (though perhaps not always) wise
thoroughly to establish their relation to each other
before introducing the inevitable dislocation and readjustment
necessitated by the wife's pregnancy and
the birth of a child.</p>

<p>In this book I am not speaking so much of the
universal sex relation as to those who find themselves
to-day in the highly civilised, artificial communities
of English-speaking people: and in our present
society there is little doubt that the early birth of a
child demands much self-sacrifice and self-restraint
from the man, one of the reflex vibrations of which is
his undefinable sense of loss and separation from his
bride. This has been confided to me by many men
who have been generous enough to trust me with
some of the secrets of their lives. Mr. C. is typical
of many others of his class.</p>

<p>He was quiet and refined, with a strong strain of
romantic love, which was entirely centred in his bride.
He was manly and sufficiently virile to feel the need
of sex intercourse, but he was unaware (as are so many
men) of the woman's corresponding need; and he did
not give his wife any orgasm. She took no pleasure,
therefore, in the physical act of union, which for her
was so incomplete.</p>

<p>Very shortly after marriage she conceived, and a
child was born ten months after the wedding day.</p>

<p>For two years after the birth of the child her vitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
was so lowered that the sex-act was to her <em>so</em> repugnant
that she refused her husband any union; and it
was thus three years after their marriage before they
met in anything like a normal way. By that time the
long separation from sex-life, and the strain on the
man, coupled with daily familiarity at home, had
dimmed, if not completely destroyed, his sense of
romance. The natural stimulation each should exert
on the other had faded, so that they never experienced
the mutual glow of rapture in their sex-union.</p>

<p>Another pair suffered similarly: Mr. and Mrs. D.
were prevented for several years by the wife's real and
fancied ill-health from having any intercourse. When,
after that time, she recovered and passionately desired
the true marriage relation, the husband felt it to
be impossible. To him it would have been, as he
expressed it, "like raping his sister."</p>

<p>Once such a thought has grown into a man's mind
it is very difficult "to recapture the first fine early
rapture." And with the loss of that early rapture the
two lose, for the rest of their lives, the irradiating joy
which is priceless not only for its beauty, but for
the vitality with which its wings are laden.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if by waiting some months (or
even years if they are young) the mated pair have
learnt to adjust themselves to each other and have experienced
the full possibilities of complete love-making,
the disturbance which is caused by the birth
of the child is in no sense a danger to their happiness,
but is its crown and completion.</p>

<p>A man once said to me&mdash;"One can endure anything
for the sake of a beloved wife." But the <em>wife</em> is
only utterly beloved when she and her married lover
have not only entered paradise together, but when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
fully realises, through insight gained by her own experiences,
the true nature of that of which she is
depriving her husband so long as her bodily condition
makes sex-union with him impossible.</p>

<p>Much has been written, and may be found in the
innumerable books on the sex-problems, as to whether
a man and woman should or should not have relations
while the wife is bearing an unborn child. In this
matter experience is very various, so that it is difficult
or impossible to give definite advice without knowing
the full circumstances of each case.</p>

<p>When, however, we observe the admirable sanctity
of the pregnant females of the woodland creatures,
and when we consider the extraordinary ignorance
and disregard of woman's needs which mark so many
of our modern customs, we cannot but think that the
safe side of this debatable question must be in the
complete continence of the woman for at least six
months before the birth of the child. I have heard
from a number of women, however, that they desire
union urgently at this time; and from others that the
thought of it is incredible. (See Addition 2, p. <a href="#Page_115">115</a>.)</p>

<p>Tolstoy strongly condemned any sex contact while
the wife was pregnant or nursing, and blames the
husband who "puts upon her the unbearable burden
of being at one and the same time a mistress, an
exhausted mother, and a sickly, irritable, hysterical
individual. And the husband loves her as his mistress,
ignores her as a mother, and hates her for the irritability
and hysteria which he himself has produced
and produces." His view is taken by many of our
noblest men.</p>

<p>While the wife feels that she cannot allow her
husband to enter the portals of her body when it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
become the sacred temple of a developing life, she
should also consider the perpetual strain which nature
imposes upon him; and the tender and loving wife
will readily find some means of giving him that
physical relief which his nature needs.</p>

<p>The exquisite, unselfish tenderness which is aroused
in a man by the sense of mental and spiritual harmony
with a wife who sympathises with, because she understands,
his needs is one of the loveliest things in
marriage. The wife who knows how to waken this
tenderness in a man raises him out of the self-centred
slough in which so many men wallow unhappily.</p>

<p>With an ardent man, wholly devoted to his wife
and long deprived of her, the time will come when
it will be sufficient for him to be near her and caress
her for relief to take place without any physical
connection.</p>

<p>After the birth of the first child the health of the
mother and of the baby both demand that there should
be no hurried beginning of a second. <em>At least</em> a year
should pass before the second little life is allowed to
begin its unfolding, so that <em>a minimum</em> of about two
years should elapse before the second child is born.</p>

<p>The importance of this, both for the mother and
for the child, is generally adequately recognised by
medical specialists, and some distinguished gynecologists
advocate as much as three or five years between
the births of successive children. While in the whole
human relation there is no slavery or torture so
horrible as coerced, unwilling motherhood, there is no
joy and pride greater than that of a woman who is
bearing the developing child of a man she adores. It
is a serious reflection on our poisoned "civilisation"
that a pregnant woman should feel shame to appear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the streets. Never will the race reach true health till
it is cured of its prurient sickness, and the prospective
mother can carry her sacred burden as a priestess in a
triumphal procession. (See Addition 3, p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>.)</p>

<p>Of the innumerable problems which touch upon the
qualities transmitted to the children by their parents,
the study of which may be covered by the general
term Eugenics, I shall here say nothing: nor shall I
deal with the problems of birth and child-rearing.
Many writers have considered these subjects, and
my purpose in this book is to present aspects of sex-life
which have been more or less neglected by others.</p>

<p>While throughout I have omitted the consideration
of abnormalities, there is one condition which verges
on the abnormal but yet touches the lives of some
married people who are individually both normal and
healthy, about which a few words need to be said.</p>

<p>It not infrequently happens that two healthy, loving
people, for no apparent reason, seem unable to have a
child. (See Addition 4, p. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>.)</p>

<p>The old-fashioned view was that the fault lay with
the woman, and the reproach of being a barren woman
is one which brought untold anguish to many hearts.
It is now beginning to be recognised, however, that
in a childless union the "fault," if fault it be, is as
often the man's as the woman's, particularly where the
husband is a brain worker in a city.</p>

<p>Though it is natural that there should not be the
same joy for the pair in a child which had not arisen
from their own supreme fusion, nevertheless, the man
who is generous and broadminded might find much
joy in a child of his wife's were the obtaining of this
child not coupled with the yielding of her body to
the embrace of another man, which is so generally and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
so naturally repugnant to a husband. The future possibilities
of science here come in. Much interesting
research has already been done on the growth of the
young of various creatures without the ordinary
fertilisation of the mother egg-cell. Then there are
the experiments by the famous Dr. Hunter at the
end of the eighteenth century, and more recent work.
See, for instance, Heape, in the "Proceedings of the
Royal Society, 1897," and Marshall's text-book of
"The Physiology of Reproduction, 1910."</p>

<p>While in such an event as these discoveries adumbrate,
the husband would have no bodily part in the
heritage of the child, yet in the creation of its spirit
he could play a profound part, the potentialities of
which appear to be almost unrecognised by humanity.</p>

<p>The idea that the soul and character of the child
can be in any degree influenced by the mental status
of the mother during the months of its development
as an embryo within her body, is apt to be greeted
with pure scepticism&mdash;for it is difficult of proof, and
repugnant to the male intellect, now accustomed to
explain life in terms of chemistry.</p>

<p>Yet all the wisest mothers whom I know vary only
in the degree of their belief in this power of the
mother. All are agreed in believing that the spiritual
and mental condition and environment of the mother
does profoundly affect the character and the mental
and spiritual powers of the child.</p>

<p>An interesting fact which strengthens the woman's
point of view, is quoted (though not in this connection)
by Marshall,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who says: "It has been found
that immunity from disease may be acquired by young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
animals being suckled by a female which had previously
become immune, the antibody to the disease
being absorbed in the ingested milk." This particular
fact is explainable in terms of chemistry; but it
seems to me more than rash for anyone in these days
of hormones from ductless glands, to deny the possibility
of mental states in the mother generating
"chemical messengers," which may impress permanent
characters in the physiological reactions of the
developing child. Ellis says (Vol. 6, "Sex and
Society," 1913): "The mother is the child's supreme
parent, and during the period from conception to birth
the hygiene of the future man can only be affected by
influences which work through her."</p>

<p>And Alfred Russel Wallace, the great naturalist,
thought the transmission of mental influence neither
impossible nor even very improbable.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I am convinced
that it takes place all the time, moulding and
influencing the hereditary factors.</p>

<p>Hence I suggest that the husband who is deprived
of normal fatherhood may yet make the child of his
wife's body partly his own, if his thoughts are with
her intensely, supportingly, and joyously throughout
the whole time of the unborn baby's growth. If he
reads to her, plays beautiful music or takes her to
hear it, and gives her the very best of his thoughts
and aspirations, mystical though the conclusion may
seem, he does attain an actual measure of fatherhood.</p>

<p>The converse is even more difficult, where the wife
is really barren and the husband capable of having
children with another woman. Then the attainment
of children by the man is impossible without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
collaboration of another woman in a manner not outwardly
recognised by our laws and customs. Even
if this done it is clear that to introduce the child
of another woman into the home is demanding a
much greater self-abnegation from the wife than is
demanded from the husband in the situation we have
just considered.</p>

<p>Many people whose ideals are very noble are yet
strangely incapable of adapting the material acts of
life to the real fulfilment of their ideals. Thus there
is a section of our community which insists that there
should be no restriction whatever of the number of
children born to married people. They think any
birth control immoral. They take their stand upon
the statement that we have no right to destroy
potential life. But if they would study a little human
or animal physiology they would find that not only
every celibate, but also every married man incessantly
and inevitably wastes myriads of germs (see p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>)]
which had the potentiality of fusion with an ovum,
and consequently could have produced a child had
opportunity been given them. For the supposed sake
of one or two of these myriad sperms which must
naturally and inevitably die, they encourage the production
of babies in rapid succession which are
weakened by their proximity while they might have
been sturdy and healthy had they been conceived
further apart from each other.</p>

<p>Such people, while awake to the claims of the unborn,
nay, even of the unconceived, are blind to the
claims of the one who should be dearest of all to the
husband, and for whose health and happiness he is
responsible. A man swayed by archaic dogma will
allow, even coerce, his wife to bear and bring forth an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
infant annually. Save where the woman is exceptional,
each child following so rapidly on its predecessor,
saps and divides the vital strength which is
available for the making of the offspring. This
generally lowers the vitality of each succeeding child,
and surely even if slowly, may murder the woman
who bears them.</p>

<p>Of course, the effects of this strain upon the woman
vary greatly according to her original health and
vitality, the conditions of her surroundings and the
intensity of the family's struggle for food. A half-starved
mother trying to bring up children in the foul
air of city slums, loses, as a rule, far more of her
family than a comfortable and well-fed woman
in the country. Nevertheless, conditions are not
everything; under the best conditions, the chances
of death of the later children of a large family,
which comes rapidly, are far greater than for the
earlier children.</p>

<p>Dr. Ploetz found that while the death-rate of first-born
infants is about 220 per thousand, the death-rate
of the seventh-born is about 330, and of the
twelfth-born is 597 per thousand. So that when
"Nature" has its way, and twelve children come to
sap a woman's vitality, so little strength has she that
nearly 60 per cent. of these later ones die. What a
waste of vitality! What a hideous orgy of agony
for the mothers to produce in anguish death-doomed,
suffering infants!</p>

<p>Forel ("The Sexual Question," 1908) says: "It
seems almost incredible that in some countries medical
men who are not ashamed to throw young men into
the arms of prostitution, blush when mention is made
of anti-conceptional methods. This false modesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
created by custom and prejudice, waxes indignant at
innocent things while it encourages the greatest
infamies."</p>

<p>It is important to observe that Holland, the country
which takes <em>most</em> care that children shall be well and
voluntarily conceived, has increased its survival-rate,
and has thereby, not diminished, but increased its
population, and has the lowest infant mortality in
Europe. While in America, where the outrageous
"Comstock Laws" confuse wise scientific prevention
with illegal abortion and label them both as
"obscene," thus preventing people from obtaining
decent hygienic knowledge, horrible and criminal
abortion is more frequent than in any other country.</p>

<p>It should be realised that all the proper, medical
methods of controlling pregnancy consist, not in
destroying an already growing embryo, but in preventing
the male sperm from reaching the unfertilised
egg cell. This may be done either by shutting the
sperms away from the opening of the womb, or by
securing the death of <em>all</em> (instead of the natural death
of all but <em>one</em>) of the two to six hundred million
sperms which enter the woman. Even when a child
is allowed to grow in its mother, all these hundreds
of millions of sperms are inevitably and naturally
destroyed every time the man has an emission, and
to add one more to these millions sacrificed by Nature
is surely no crime! To kill quickly the ejaculated
sperms which would otherwise die and decompose
naturally, is a simple matter. Their minute and uncovered
bodies are plasmolised in weak acid, such as
vinegar and water, or by a solution of quinine, or by
many other substances.</p>

<p>To those who protest that we have no right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
interfere with the course of Nature, one must point
out that the whole of civilisation, everything which
separates man from animals, is an interference with
what such people commonly call "Nature."</p>

<p>Nothing in the cosmos can be against Nature, for
it all forms part of the great processes of the universe.</p>

<p>Actions differ, however, in their relative positions
in the scale of things. Only those actions are worthy
which lead the race onwards to a higher and fuller
completion and the perfecting of its powers, which
steer the race into the main current of that stream of
life and vitality which courses through us and impels
us forward.</p>

<p>It is a sacred duty of all who dare to hand on the
awe-inspiring gift of life, to hand it on in a vessel as
fit and perfect as they can fashion, so that the body
may be the strongest and most beautiful instrument
possible in the service of the soul they summon to
play its part in the mystery of material being.</p>

<h2>Chapter X.</h2>

<h3>Society</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Love is fed not by what it takes, but by what it gives, and
that excellent dual love of man and wife must be fed also by the
love they give to others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edward Carpenter</span>.</p></blockquote>


<p>Man, even the commonplace modern man, is
romantic. He craves consciously or unconsciously
for the freedom, the beauty, and the
adventure which his forefathers found in their virgin
forests. This craving, transmuted, changed out of
recognition by civilised life and modern circumstances,
is yet a factor not to be ignored in the relationship of
the sexes.</p>

<p>The "bonds of matrimony," so often referred to
with ribald laughter, touch, and perhaps secretly gall,
even the most romantic and devoted husband. If to
the sincere and friendly question: "What is most
difficult in married life for the man?" one gets the
sincere and rueful answer&mdash;that answer may be
summed up in the words "perpetual propinquity."</p>

<p>Of this, the wife, particularly if she be really in
love, is seldom fully aware. If her husband is her
true lover, his tenderness and real devotion will give
him the wit to conceal it. But though by concealment
he may preserve the unruffled surface of their happiness,
yet the longing to be roving is not completely
extinguished. In the true lover this unspoken, unconscious
longing is perhaps less a desire to set out
upon a fresh journey than a longing to experience
again the exquisite joy of the return; to re-live the
magic charm of the approach to the spot in which the
loved one is living her life, into the sacred separateness
of which the lover breaks, and, like the Prince by his
kiss, to stir her to fresh activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>As will be realised by those who have understood
the preceding chapters, each coming together of man
and wife, even if they have been mated for many years,
should be a fresh adventure; each winning should
necessitate a fresh wooing.</p>

<p>Yet what a man often finds so hard is to come to
that wooing with full ardour and with that complete
sense of romance which alone can render it utterly
delightful, if the woman he is to woo has been in a
too uninterrupted and prosaic relation with him in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Most men, of course, have their businesses apart
from their homes, but in the home lives of the great
mass of middle-class people the Victorian tradition
still too largely preponderates, and the mated pair
bore or deaden each other during the daily routine.</p>

<p>To a very thoughtful couple whom I have known,
so precious was the sense of romantic joy in one
another that they endeavoured to perpetuate it by
living in different houses.</p>

<p>Such a measure, however, is not likely to suit many
people, particularly where there are children. Yet
even without bodily separation (which must always
entail expense) or any measure of freedom not at
everyone's command, much can be done to retain that
sense of spiritual freedom in which alone the full joy
of loving union can be experienced.</p>

<p>But even intellectual and spiritual freedom is often
rendered impossible in present-day marriage.</p>

<p>The beautiful desire for ideal unity which is so
strong in most hearts is perhaps the original cause of
one of the most deadening features in many marriages.
In the endeavour to attain the ideal unity, one or
other partner consciously or unconsciously imposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his or her will and opinions first upon the wife or
husband, and then upon the children as they grow up.</p>

<p>The typical self-opinionated male which this course
develops, while a subject for laughter in plays and
novels, a laughter which hastens his extermination, is
yet by no means extinct. In his less exaggerated form
such a man may often be an idealist, but he is
essentially an idealist of narrow vision. The peace,
the unity, for which he craves is superficially attained;
but it takes acuter eyes than his to see that it is attained
not by harmonious intermingling, but by super-position
and destruction.</p>

<p>I have known a romantic man of this type,
apparently unaware that he was encroaching upon his
wife's personality, who yet endeavoured not only to
choose her books and her friends for her, but "prohibited"
her from buying the daily newspaper to
which she had been accustomed for years before her
marriage, saying that one newspaper was enough for
them both, and blandly ignoring the fact that he took
it with him out of the house before she had an opportunity
of reading it. This man posed to himself more
successfully than to others, not only as a romantic
man, but as a model husband; and he reproached his
wife for jeopardising their perfect unity whenever she
accepted an invitation in which he was not included.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in homes where the avowed
desire is for the modern freedom of intellectual life
for both partners, there is very frequently a bickering,
a sense of disharmony and unrest that dispels the
peace and the air of restful security which is an
essential feature of a true home.</p>

<p>It is one of the most difficult things in the world
for two people of different opinions to retain their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
own opinions without each endeavouring to convert
or coerce the other, and at the same time to feel the
same tender trust in the judgment of the other that
each would have felt had they agreed.</p>

<p>It takes a generous and beautiful heart to see beauty
and dignity in the attitude of a mate who is looking
at the other side of a vital question.</p>

<p>But the very fact that it <em>does</em> take a beautiful and
generous heart to do this thing proves it well worth
the doing.</p>

<p>If the easier way is chosen and the two mutually
conceal their views when they differ, or the stronger
partner coerces the weaker into hiding those traits
which give personality to an individual, the result is
an impoverishing of both, and through that very fact,
an impoverishment, a lowering of the love which both
sought to serve.</p>

<p>In marriage each one dreams that he will find the
Understander&mdash;the one from whom he may set out
into the world in search of treasures of knowledge
and experience, and before whom the spoils may
be exhibited without thought of rivalry, and
with the certainty of glad apprisal. Treasures,
dear to our own hearts but of no value to others,
should here find appreciation, and here the tender
super-sensitive germ of an idea may be watered
and tended till its ripe beauty is ready to burst upon
the world.</p>

<p>As marriage is at present such tenderness and such
stimulating appreciation is much more likely to come
from the woman to the man and his work than from
the man to the woman. For too long have men been
accustomed to look upon woman's views, and in particular
on her intellectual opinions, as being something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
demanding at the most a bland humouring beneath
the kindest smiles.</p>

<p>Even from the noblest man, the woman of sensitive
personality to-day feels an undercurrent as of surprised
congratulation when she has anything to say
worth his <em>serious</em> attention outside that department of
life supposed to belong to her "sphere." Thus man
robs his wedded self of a greatness which the dual
unity might reach.</p>

<p>But in marriage the mutual freedom and respect for
opinion, vitally important though it be, is not sufficient
for the full development of character. Life demands
ever-widening interests. Owing partly to the differentiation
of many types of individuals due to the
specialisation of civilisation, which interests thoughtful
individuals, and partly to the transmutation of his
old vagrant instinct, man increasingly desires to touch
and to realise the lives of his fellows. In the lives of
others our hearts and understanding may find perpetual
adventures into the new and strange.</p>

<p>Individual human beings, even the noblest and
most complex yet evolved, have but a share of the
innumerable faculties of the race. Hence even in a
supremely happy marriage, which touches, as does the
mystic in his raptures, a realisation of the whole
universe, there cannot lie the <em>whole</em> of life's experience.
Outside the actual lives of the pair there
must always be many types of thought and many
potentialities which can only be realised in the lives
of other people.</p>

<p>In the complete human relation friends of all grades
are needed, as well as a mate. Marriage, however,
in its present form is too often made to curtail the
enjoyment of intimate friendships. The reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
this is partly the social etiquette, which, though discarded
in the highest levels of society, still lingers in
many circles, of inviting the husband and the wife
together upon all social occasions. It is true that they
are separated at the dinner table, but they are always
within the possibility of earshot of each other, which
very often deadens their potentialities for being entertaining.
The mere fact of being overheard repeating
something one may have already said elsewhere is
sufficient to prevent some people from telling their
best stories, or from expressing their real views upon
important matters.</p>

<p>And, still more serious barrier to joy, so primitive,
so little evolved are we even yet, there is in most
human beings a strong streak of sex-jealousy. For
either mate to be allowed to go out uncriticised into
the world, is to demand, if not more than the other
is willing to give, at least a measure of trust which
by its rarity appears nowadays as something conspicuously
fine.</p>

<p>Jealousy, which is one of the most frequent
shadows cast by the blight of love, is very apt to
sow a distrust in one which makes a normal life for
the other partner impossible.</p>

<p>It is hard to say in which sex the feeling is more
strongly developed. It takes special forms under
different circumstances, and if a nature is predisposed
towards it, it is one of the most difficult characteristics
to eradicate.</p>

<p>Custom, and generations of traditions, seem to
have imprinted on our race the false idea that marital
fidelity is to be strengthened by coercive bonds. We
are slowly growing out of this, and nowadays in
most books giving advice to young wives there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
section telling them that a man should be allowed
his men friends after marriage.</p>

<p>But this is not enough. There should be complete
and unquestioning trust on both sides. The man and
the woman should each be free to go unchallenged by
a thought on solitary excursions, or on visits, weekends
or walking tours, without the possibility of a
breath of jealousy or suspicion springing up in the
heart of one or the other.</p>

<p>It is true that many natures are not yet ready for
such trust, and might abuse such freedom. But the
baser natures will always find a method of gratifying
their desires, and are not likely to err more in trusted
freedom than they would inevitably have done
through secret intrigues if held in jealous bondage.</p>

<p>While, on the other hand, it is only in the fresh
unsullied air of such freedom that the fullest and
most perfect love can develop. In the marriage relation
it is supremely true that only by loosening the
bonds can one bind two hearts indissolubly together.</p>

<p>When they are sometimes physically apart married
lovers attain the closest spiritual union. For with
sensitive spirits&mdash;and they are the only ones who
know the highest pinnacles of love&mdash;periods of
separation and solitude can be revivifying and recreative.</p>

<p>So great is the human soul that some of its beauty
is hidden by nearness: it needs distance between it
and the beholder to be perceived in its true
perspective.</p>

<p>To the realisation of the beauty and the enjoyment
of solitude, woman in general tends to be less awake
than man. This, perhaps, is due to the innumerable
generations during which the claims of her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and of domestic life have robbed her of Nature's
healing gift.</p>

<p>Although it is merely incidental to the drama, yet
to me the most poignant thing in Synge's beautiful
play <i>Deirdré</i> is that she could feel inevitable tragedy
when the first thought of something apart from herself
crosses her lover's mind. Deirdré and her lover
had been together for seven years in an unbroken and
idyllic intimacy, and she feels that all is finished, and
that her doom, the knell of their joy, had struck,
when for the first time she perceived in him a half-formed
thought of an occupation apart from her.</p>

<p>This ancient weakness of her sex must be
conquered, and is being conquered by the modern
woman.</p>

<p>While modern marriage is tending to give ever
more and more freedom to each of the partners, there
is at the same time a unity of work and interest growing
up which brings them together on a higher plane
than the purely domestic one which was so confining
to the women and so dull to the men. Every year
one sees a widening of the independence and the range
of the pursuits of women: but still, far too often,
marriage puts an end to woman's intellectual life.
Marriage can never reach its full stature until women
possess as much intellectual freedom and freedom of
opportunity within it as do their partners.</p>

<p>That at present the majority of women neither
desire freedom for creative work, nor would know
how to use it, is only a sign that we are still living
in the shadow of the coercive and dwarfing influences
of the past.</p>

<p>In an interesting article on woman's intellectual
work, W. Thomas (1907, "Sex and Society") says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The American woman, with the enjoyment of greater liberty,
has made an approach toward the standards of professional
scholarship, and some individuals stand at the very top in their
university studies and examinations. The trouble with these
cases is that they are either swept away and engulfed by the
modern system of marriage, or find themselves excluded in some
intangible way from association with men in the fullest sense,
and no career open to their talents.</p></blockquote>

<p>He sees clearly that this is but a passing phase in
the development of our society, and he advocates a
wider scope for the play of married women's powers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The practice of an occupational activity of her own choosing,
and a generous attitude towards this on the part of the man, would
contribute to relieve the strain and make marriage more
frequently successful.</p></blockquote>

<p>When woman naturally develops the powers latent
within her, man will find at his side not only a mate,
free and strong, but a desirable friend and an intellectual
comrade.</p>

<p>The desire for freedom, both for physical and
mental exploration and for experiences outside the
sacred enclosure of the home, may at first sight appear
to be conflicting and entirely incompatible with
the ideal of closer and more perfect unity between the
married pair. But this conflict is only apparent,
though it is true that most writers have failed to
realise this. Consequently in some sections of the
writing and teaching of the "advanced" schools there
are claims only for increased freedom&mdash;a freedom to
wander at will&mdash;a freedom in which the wanderer does
not return to his fixed centre.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are those who realise principally
the beauty of married unity, and, concentrating
on the demand for the unity and extremest
stability on the part of the married pair, are very apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to ignore the enriching flow of a wide life's experiences.
They try to dam up the fertilising tide of life,
and thus, though they are unconscious of what they
are doing, they tend to reduce the richness and beauty
of marriage.</p>

<p>It is for the young people of the new generation
to realise that the two currents of longing which
spring up within them&mdash;the longing for a full life-experience
and the longing for a close union with a
lifelong mate&mdash;are not incompatible, but are actually
both essential parts of the more perfect and fuller
beauty of the future that already seeks to find its
expression in their lives.</p>

<p>Ellen Key ("Love and Marriage") seems to fear
the widening of the married woman's life, and she
writes as though the aspiration to do professional and
intellectual work of a high order must dwarf and
sterilise the mother in the married woman.</p>

<p>She writes of a more northerly people, the Scandinavians,
and it may be true of her countrywomen, I do
not know. But it is <em>not</em> essentially and universally
true. I am writing of the English, the English of
to-day, and though we also have among us that
dwarfed and sterilised type of woman, she forms in
our community a dwindling minority. The majority
of our best women enter marriage and motherhood,
or else long for a marriage more beautiful than the
warped mockery of it that is offered them.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Stetson says ("Women and Economics"):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the primal physical functions of maternity the human
female cannot show that her supposed specialisation to these
uses has improved her fulfilment of them, rather the opposite.
The more freely the human mother mingles in the natural
industries of a human creature, as in the case of the savage woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the peasant woman, the working woman everywhere who is not
overworked, the more rightly she fulfils these functions.</p>

<p>The more absolutely the woman is segregated to sex-functions
only, cut off from all economic use and made wholly dependent
on the sex-relation as means of a livelihood, the more pathological
does her motherhood become. The over-development of sex
caused by her economic dependence on the male reacts unfavourably
on her essential duties. She is too female for the perfect
motherhood!</p></blockquote>

<p>The majority of our young women, I am convinced,
have in them the potentiality of a full and
perfected love. So, too, have the majority of our
young men. For the best type of young man to-day
is tired of polygamy; he has seen enough in his
father's and friends' lives of the weariness of the
sinister, secret polygamy, that hides itself and rots
the race under the protecting cloak of the supposed
monogamy of our social system.</p>

<p>But as things are at present in England, the young
man who marries, however much he may be in love,
is generally too ignorant (as has been indicated in the
preceding chapters) to give his wife all her nature
requires. Then, sooner or later, comes the sequence
of disappointments which culminate in the longing
for a fresh adventure.</p>

<p>As one young husband said to me, "A decent man
can't go on having unions with his wife when she
obviously does not enjoy them," and so he is forced
to "go elsewhere." "And they call us polygamists!
We are not polygamists any longer. But marriage is
a rotten failure," was his verdict.</p>

<p>No. They are not polygamists, the finest young
men of the present and of the future. Most men to-day
are not in their heart of hearts polygamists, in
spite of all the outward signs to the contrary; in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the fact that so few of them have remained faithful
to one woman. But they are ignorant of the sex-laws
and traditions, that sex-knowledge which was the
heritage of much less civilised tribes, and so they
have trampled and crushed out the very thing for the
growth of which their hearts are aching.</p>

<p>Hence secretly (for in a marriage that is at least
superficially happy the man seldom does this openly)
the man begins to crave for another type of society
and he "goes elsewhere." Not, it is true, to find, or
even in the hope of finding, what he would get from
a perfect marriage; but often to satisfy in some
measure that yearning for fresh experience, for
romance, and for that sense of fusion with another
in the romantic experience which, even if it is only a
delusion of the senses, is yet one of the most precious
things life has to offer.</p>

<p>It is hard, indeed in many cases it seems impossible,
for a good woman to understand what it is that
draws her husband from her. Restricted by habit and
convention in the exercise of her faculties, she is unaware
of the ever-narrowing range of her interest and
her powers of conversation. The home life tends to
become that of a fenced pond, instead of a great ocean
with innumerable currents. From the restricted and
fenced man's instinct is ever to escape. Man's opportunities
for exploration in the cities are few, and the
prostitute is one of the most obvious doors of escape
into new experiences.</p>

<p>Women feel a so righteous and instinctive horror
of prostitution, and regarding it they experience an
indignation so intense, that they do not seek to understand
the man's attitude.</p>

<p>The prostitute, however, sometimes supplies an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
element which is not purely physical, and which
is often lacking in the wife's relation with her
husband, an element of charm and mutual gaiety in
pleasure.</p>

<p>If good women realised this, while they would
judge and endeavour to eliminate prostitution no
less strenuously, they might be in a better position to
begin their efforts to free men from the hold that
social disease has upon them.</p>

<p>It is perhaps impossible to find the beginning of a
vicious circle, but the first step out of it must be the
realisation that one is within it, and the realisation of
some, at any rate, of its component parts.</p>

<p>Man, through prudery, through the custom of
ignoring the woman's side of marriage and considering
his own whim as marriage law, has largely lost
the art of stirring a chaste partner to physical love.
He therefore deprives her of a glamour, the loss of
which he deplores, for he feels a lack not only of
romance and beauty, but of something higher which
is mystically given as the result of the complete
union. He blames his wife's "coldness" instead of
his own want of art. Then he seeks elsewhere for
the things she could have given him had he known
how to win them. And she, knowing that the shrine
has been desecrated, is filled with righteous indignation,
though generally as blind as he is to the true
cause of what has occurred.</p>

<p>Manifold and far-reaching, influencing the whole
structure of society not only in this country, but in
every country and at every time, have been the
influences which have grown up from the root-fallacy
in the marriage relation.</p>

<p>Then there is another cause for the dulling of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wife's bright charm&mdash;her inferior position in the eyes
of the law. It is indeed a serious matter, as Jean
Finot says, "that, under present conditions, the
mistress keeps certain liberties which are denied to
married women."</p>

<p>The past and its history have been studied by many,
and we may leave it. What concerns the present
generation of young married people is to-day and the
future. The future is full of hope. Already one sees
beginning to grow up a new relationship between the
units composing society.</p>

<p>In the noblest society love will hold sway. The
love of mates will always be the supremest life experience,
but it will no longer be an experience exclusive
and warped.</p>

<p>The love of friends and children, of comrades and
fellow-workers, will but serve to develop every power
of the two who are mates. By mingling the greatness
of their individual stature they can achieve together
something that, had both or either been dwarfed and
puny individuals, would have remained for ever
unattainable.</p>

<p>The whole trend of the evolution of human society
has been toward an increased coherence of all its parts,
until at the present time it is already almost possible
to say that the community has an actual life on a plane
above that of all the individuals composing it: that
the community, in fact, is a super-entity. It is through
the community of human beings, and not in our individual
lives, that we reach an ultimate permanence
upon this globe.</p>

<p>When our relation to the community is fully
realised, it will be seen that the health, the happiness,
and the consequent powers of every individual, concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
not only his own life, but also affect the whole
community of which he is a member.</p>

<p>The happiness of a perfect marriage, which enhances
the vitality of the private life, renders one not
only capable of adding to the stream of the life-blood
of the community in children, but by marriage one is
also rendered a fitter and more perfect instrument for
one's own particular work, the results of which should
be shared by society as a whole, and in the tempering
and finishing of which society plays a part.</p>

<p>Thus it is the concern of the whole community
that marriage should be as perfect, and hence as
joyous, as possible; so that the powers which should
be set free and created for the purpose of the whole
community should not be frittered away in the useless
longing and disappointment engendered by ignorance,
narrow restrictions, and low ideals.</p>

<p>In the world the happily mated pair should be like
a great and beautiful light; a light not hid under a
bushel, but one whose beams shine through the lives
of all around them.</p>

<h3>The Glorious Unfolding</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let knowledge grow from more to more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">but more of reverence in us dwell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>We are surrounded in this world by processes
and transmutations so amazing
that were they not taking place around
us hourly they would be scouted as impossible
imaginings.</p>

<p>A mind must be dull and essentially lacking in
wonderment which, without amazement, can learn for
the first time that the air we breathe, apparently so
uniform in its invisible unity, is in reality composed
of two principal, and several other, gases. The two
gases, however, are but mixed as wine may be with
water, and each gas by itself is a colourless air, visually
like that mixture of the two which we call the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Much greater is the miracle of the composition of
water. It is made of only two gases, one of them a
component of the air we breathe, and the other
similarly invisible and odourless, but far lighter.
These two invisible gases, when linked in a proportion
proper to their natures, fuse and are no longer
ethereal and invisible, but precipitate in a new substance&mdash;water.</p>

<p>The waves of the sea with their thundering power,
the sparkling tides of the river buoying the ships, are
but the transmuted resultants of the union of two
invisible gases. And this, in its simplest terms, is a
parable of the infinitely complex and amazing transmutations
of married love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellis expresses the strange mystery of one of the
physical sides of love when he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What has always baffled men in the contemplation of sexual
love is the seeming inadequacy of its cause, the immense
discrepancy between the necessarily circumscribed regions of
mucous membrane which is the final goal of such love and the
sea of world-embracing emotions to which it seems the door, so
that, as Remy de Gourmont has said, "the mucous membranes,
by an ineffable mystery, enclose in their obscure folds all the
riches of the infinite." It is a mystery before which the thinker
and the artist are alike overcome.</p></blockquote>

<p>To me, however, the recent discoveries of physiology
seem to afford a key which may unlock a chamber
of the mystery and admit us to one of the halls of
the palace of truth. The hormones (see page <a href="#Page_61">61</a>) in
each individual body pour from one organ and affect
another, and thus influence the whole character of the
individual's life processes. The visible secretions
and the most subtle essences which pass during union
between man and woman, affect the lives of each and
are essentially vital to each other. As I see them, the
man and the woman are each organs, parts, of the
other. And in the strictest scientific, as well as in a
mystical, sense they <em>together</em> are a single unit, an
individual entity. There is a <em>physiological</em> as well as
a spiritual truth in the words "they twain shall be
one flesh."</p>

<p>In love it is not only that the yearning of the bonds
of affinity to be satisfied is met by the linking with
another, but that out of this union there grows a new
and unprecedented creation.</p>

<p>In this I am not speaking of the bodily child which
springs from the love of its parents, but of the super-physical
entity created by the perfect union in love
of man and woman. Together, united by the love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
bonds which hold them, they are a new and wondrous
thing surpassing, and different from, the arithmetical
sum of them both when separate.</p>

<p>So seldom has the perfection of this new creation
been experienced, that we are still far short even of
imagining its full potentialities, but that it must have
mighty powers we dimly realise.</p>

<p>Youths and maidens stirred by the attraction of
love, feel hauntingly and inarticulately that there is
before them an immense and beautiful experience:
feel as though in union with the beloved there will be
added powers of every sort which have no measure
in terms of the ordinary unmated life.</p>

<p>These prophetic dreams, if they are not true of
each individual life, are yet true of the race as a whole.
For in the dreams of youth to-day is a foreshadowing
of the reality of the future.</p>

<p>So accustomed have we recently become to accept
one aspect of organic evolution, that we tend to see
in youth only a recapitulation of our race's history.
The well-worn phrase "Ontogeny repeats Phylogeny"
has helped to concentrate our attention on the
fact that the young in their development, in ourselves
as in the animals, go through many phases which
resemble the stages through which the whole race
must have passed in the course of its evolution.</p>

<p>While this is true, there is another characteristic
of youth: It is prophetic!</p>

<p>The dreams of youth, which each young heart
expects to see fulfilled in its own life, seem so often
to fade unfulfilled. But that is because the wonderful
powers of youth are not supplied with the necessary
tool&mdash;knowledge. And so potentialities, which could
have worked miracles, are allowed to atrophy and die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But as humanity orients itself more truly, more
and more will the knowledge and experience of the
whole race be placed at the disposal of all youth
on its entry into life.</p>

<p>Then that glorious upspringing of the racial ideal,
which finds its expression in each unspoiled generation
of youth, will at last meet with a store of knowledge
sufficient for its needs, and will find ready as a tool
to its hand the accumulated and sifted wisdom of the
race.</p>

<p>Then youth will be spared the blunders and the
pain and the unconscious self-destruction that to-day
leaves scarcely anyone untouched.</p>

<p>In my own life, comparatively short and therefore
lacking in experience though it be, I have known both
personally and vicariously so much anguish that might
have been prevented by knowledge. This impels me
not to wait till my experience and researches are complete,
and my life and vital interest are fading, but to
hand on at once those gleanings of wisdom I have
already accumulated which may help the race to understand
itself. Hence I conclude this little book, for,
though incomplete, it contains some of the vital
things youth should be told.</p>

<p>In all life activities, house-building, hunting or
any other, where intellectual and oral tradition comes
in, as it does with the human race, "instinct" tends
to die out. Thus the human mother is far less able
to manage her baby without instruction than is a cat
her kittens; although the human mother at her best
has, in comparison with the cat, an infinitude of duties
toward, and influences over, her child.</p>

<p>A similar truth holds in relation to marriage.
The century-long following of various "civilised"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
customs has not only deprived our young people of
most of the instinctive knowledge they might have
possessed, but has given rise to innumerable false and
polluting customs.</p>

<p>Though many write on the art of managing
children, few have anything to say about the art of
marriage, save those who have some dogma, often
theological or subversive of natural law, to proclaim.</p>

<p>Any fundamental truth regarding marriage is
rendered immeasurably difficult to ascertain because
of the immense ranges of variety in human beings,
even of the same race, many of which result from the
artificial conditions and the unnatural stimuli so prevalent
in what we call civilisation. To attempt anything
like a serious study of marriage in all its varieties
would be a monumental work. Those who have even
partially undertaken it have tended to become entangled
in a maze of abnormalities, so that the needs
of the normal, healthy, romantic person have been
overlooked.</p>

<p>Each pair, therefore, has tended to repeat the
blunders from which it might have been saved, and
to stumble blindly in a maze of difficulties which are
not the essential heritage of humanity, but are due
to the unreasoning folly of our present customs.</p>

<p>I have written this book for those who enter marriage
normally and healthily, and with optimism and
hope.</p>

<p>If they learn its lessons they may be saved from
some of the pitfalls in which thousands have
wrecked their happiness, but they must not think that
they will thereby easily attain the perfection of
marriage. There are myriad subtleties in the adjustment
of any two individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Each pair must, using the tenderest and most
delicate touches, sound and test each other, learning
their way about the intricacies of each other's
hearts.</p>

<p>Sometimes, with all the knowledge and the best
will in the world, two who have married find that
they cannot fuse their lives; of this tragedy I have not
here anything to say; but ordinary unhappiness would
be less frequent than it is were the tenderness of
<em>knowledge</em> applied to the problem of mutual adjustment
from the first day of marriage.</p>

<p>All the deepest and highest forces within us impel
us to evolve an ever nobler and tenderer form of life-long
monogamy as our social ideal. While the
thoughtful and tenderhearted must seek, with ever
greater understanding, to ease and comfort those who
miss this joyful natural development, reformers in
their zeal for side-issues must not forget the main
growth of the stock. The beautiful sense for love in
the hearts of the young should be encouraged, and
they should have access to the knowledge of how to
cultivate it, instead of being diverted by the clamour
for "freedom" to destroy it.</p>

<p>Disillusioned middle age is apt to look upon the
material side of the marriage relation, to see its solid
surface in the cold, dull light of everyday experience;
while youth, irradiated by the glow of its
dreams, is unaware how its aerial and celestial
phantasies are broken and shattered when unsuspectingly
brought up against the hard facts of
physical reality.</p>

<p>The transmutation of material facts by celestial
phantasies is to some extent within the power of
humanity, even the imperfect humanity of to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>When knowledge and love together go to the
making of each marriage, the joy of <em>that new unit,
the pair</em> will reach from the physical foundations of
its bodies to the heavens where its head is crowned
with stars.</p>

<p>A curious rigidity of mental and physical capacity
seems to characterise some excellent and well-meaning
people, and among those whose marriages unaccountably
fail to reach just that height of perfection
in a physical sense which they may intellectually
desire, are those who are either entirely ignorant that
sex union may be accomplished in many various positions,
or those who consider any other position but
the most usual one to be wrong.</p>

<p>Yet, curiously enough, it sometimes comes to
light that a pair do not even know the usual position,
and in my own experience several couples who have
failed to have children, or have failed to obtain the
complete delight of union, have revealed that the
woman did not know that it is not only her arms
which should embrace her lover. Consequently,
entry was to him both difficult and sometimes
impossible.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the encouragement of that
spontaneous movement which comes so naturally to
those who are highly stirred, needs in far too many
of our moderns to be cultivated. A pair should,
impelled by the great wave of feeling within them,
be as pliable as the sea-plants moved by the rushing
tides, and they should discover for themselves
which of the innumerable possible positions of
equilibrium results in the greatest mutual satisfaction.
In this matter, as in so many others of the
more intimate phases of sex life, there should not
harden a routine, but the body should become at the
service of intense feeling a keen and pliable instrument.</p>

<h2><i>Addition</i> 2 (<i>to page</i> 83)</h2>


<p>It must be remembered that the parallel of the
more primitive creatures cannot be pressed too far,
because in a thousand ways we highly civilised
human beings have developed in fresh directions
away from our ancestral habits. This question, of
whether or not it is right and wise to have sex unions
during pregnancy, is one on which scientific research
should be undertaken. Far too few men and women
are clean-minded and frank enough to record their
feelings in this connection, and far too few medical
men delicately sympathetic enough to elicit the facts
even from those women who are personally conscious
of them. The little evidence which I have acquired
through direct personal confidences about this subject
points in absolutely conflicting directions, and there is
little doubt that in this particular, even more than in
so many others, the health, needs, and mental
condition of women who are bearing children
vary profoundly. From one distinguished medical
specialist I have acquired the interesting suggestion
that in one or two cases among his own patients,
where the prospective mother had desired unions and
the husband had denied them thinking it in her interest,
the doctor had observed that the children
seemed to grow up restless, uncontrollable, and with
an unduly marked tendency to self-abuse. On this
most suggestive and important idea, I would gladly
obtain evidence from parents and the medical profession,
for only from a large number of cases can
reliable conclusions be drawn. But just as in popular
opinion it is good for the child and the woman to
gratify any harmless fancy for food which she may
develop, so, in my opinion, it seems probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
any desire for moderate and careful sex union
between the prospective mother and the father of the
coming child should be gratified in the interests of
all three. But this opinion is expressed merely
provisionally, and largely in response to a number
of inquirers who have asked me about this point.
Immoderate and excessive sex union must undoubtedly
be looked upon as an unfavourable
symptom, and a practising doctor should be consulted
about it.</p>

<p>A woman who is bearing a child by the man she
deeply loves, has an intense longing that he should
share, so far as is possible, in influencing that child
while it is coming, and that he should be as near and
as close to it and to her as is possible. The basis of
this longing we may well imagine may be not only a
tender sentiment of the brain, but may depend on
that fine sensual interchange of ultra-microscopic
particles which must take place between skin and
skin during physical contact, the idea of which is so
beautifully foreshadowed in Carpenter's "Love's
Coming of Age."</p>

<p>A woman who is bearing a child should not&mdash;indeed,
she cannot&mdash;have the intensest form of
muscular orgasm, but this subtler and deeper sweetening
and harmonising union has not only a romantic
justification, but will, I think, be proved by Science,
when Science becomes sensitive enough to handle
such delicate things, to have a real bio-chemical basis.</p>

<p>As so many people lack a due visualising imagination,
perhaps I should add that the ordinary position
of union is not suitable&mdash;indeed, may be very well
most harmful&mdash;to a woman during this time; but she
and her husband can easily so intertwine themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that the weight of both is lying upon the bed or upon
pillows, and so no pressure falls upon the woman.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><i>Addition</i> 3 (<i>to page</i> 85)</h2>


<p>Although it is out of the province of this book to
give advice about the more material and better-known
details of the general management of the
health of the prospective mother, yet there are one
or two very important points generally overlooked
which profoundly affect both the woman's health and
happiness, and may affect also the child. For instance,
leading medical experts are in the habit of
considering the "morning sickness" which is so
usual in the early months of pregnancy as a "physiological
process," and to look upon it complacently
as perfectly normal and to be endured as a matter of
course. This marks a deplorably low standard of
health. Why should this comparatively small but
nauseating experience accompany what should be
among the most rapturously beautiful months of a
woman's life? In my opinion there is no reason for
this at all, except that medical men have been blind
leaders of the blind; accustomed always to deal with
invalids or semi-invalids, they have lost the instinct
to demand of humanity a high and buoyant state of
health, while women so harried by the undue drains
of unregulated sex experience, with vitality so
lowered by "civilised" life, have seen one another
suffering on all sides until they too have lost the
racial memory of radiant bodily beauty and health.</p>

<p>Here and there an exceptional woman has gone
through the months of pregnancy with no handicap,
with not even morning sickness. Instead of looking
upon her as an enviable exception, as all do now, look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
upon her as the normal standard which all should
attain! One of the aids to attaining this standard
for every prospective mother would be the knowledge
by all adult women that, directly they know
they are bearing a child, they should instantly discard
not only all corsets, but all clothes of every kind
which are heavy and close or which have any definite
bands or tight fastenings. Specialists are content to
say no harm accrues if a woman wears "comfortable"
corsets until the third or fourth month. I
denounce this as misleading folly. The sensitiveness
to pressure, often unconscious, at such a time is
extraordinary, and the penalty of even the lightest
pressure is the morning sickness. The standard of
clothing should be so light, so loose, that a butterfly
could walk upon the bare skin beneath the clothes
without breaking its wings. This may seem exaggerated
to nearly everyone, but it is a very profound
truth.</p>

<p>Another aid to buoyant health during this time
is to add to the diet the largest possible amount of
uncooked fruit, particularly oranges, plums, and
apples.</p>

<p>Various books have been written on the health in
pregnancy, though few of these are enlightened.
Although one must deplore the many mistakes in
elementary chemistry which are made therein, by far
the best of the books on this subject known to me
is Dr. Alice Stockham's "Tokology." In this book
it is only such comparative trifles as the calling of
carbonaceous material <em>carbonates</em> which, though
sufficient to prejudice the scientific mind against the
rest of her work, does not really affect the profound
truth of the gist of her message&mdash;a message which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was first given to the public by a wise old Englishman
long ago.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><i>Addition</i> 4 (<i>to page</i> 85)</h2>


<p>Owing partly to the incredible ignorance of our
bodily structure in which it is possible for a grown
man or woman not only to enter marriage but to be
married for years, sometimes apparently childless
unions are not in any sense due to the incapacity of
either partner for parenthood, but are due sometimes
to trifling impediments which can easily be removed,
or to trifling peculiarities of construction which can
very simply be overcome.</p>

<p>While the great majority of married couples are
actually suffering, or would suffer, without the exertion
of definite control, from too many pregnancies
there are still&mdash;particularly in the middle and
upper classes&mdash;many would-be parents who long for
children but seem to be mysteriously deprived of
them. Doctors may have examined both the man
and the woman, and pronounced them perfectly
normal, perfectly healthy, and perfectly capable of
having children together, and yet children do not
come. Sometimes this is caused by an undue activity
of a slightly acid secretion on the part of the woman,
a secretion doing her no harm and of which she is
quite unconscious, but which may be sufficient to
render the active sperm impotent. Sometimes,
therefore, it is sufficient to ensure conception for the
woman to syringe the vagina with a little weak
neutralising solution such as sodium carbonate
shortly before sex union. Another cause which
sometimes operates against the vital sperm penetrating
to the waiting ovum is an excess of mucus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
at the mouth of the womb. In such a case it is
important that a really complete and muscularly
energetic orgasm should be achieved by the woman,
not before but coincident with or after the sperm has
been ejaculated. It is often argued that it makes no
difference whether or not the woman has a complete
orgasm, for so many cases are recorded in which
women who have never experienced an orgasm have
had many children; but it is generally forgotten that
women are of many different types, and while one
type of woman, the very fruitful mother with a wide
vagina and but slight internal mucus, may conceive
a dozen times without an orgasm, the more highly
nervous, equally perfect, woman may only conceive
on the occasion when she experiences an orgasm
whilst the sperm are actually in the vagina.</p>

<p>Another slight obstacle to conception on the part
of a woman which is not infrequent is the position
of the mouth of the womb and the relation of the
vaginal canal, which may be such that the spermatic
fluid tends to be lost without any of it penetrating
the orifice of the womb itself. To overcome this it
is often sufficient for the woman to turn over directly
the act of union is complete and lie face downwards
for a few hours.</p>

<p>Without any question, all women have times of
greater or less reproductive vitality, but in some
women this is less marked than in others, and with
some conception may take place at almost any date
in the menstrual month; but with other women there
is a group of days ranging from three or four to a
dozen or more, in which conception seems to be
impossible; while, on the other side of this group of
neutral days, the days grade upwards towards a date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of greater reproductive potency. Therefore, a
woman and her husband who desire children, but
have not after some years of marriage had the good
fortune to attain parenthood, should choose for their
acts of union those days on which conception is most
likely. It is generally found that the most certain
date for conception is&mdash;with very few exceptions&mdash;about
the last day of the monthly period, or the day
or two immediately after it; so that the husband who
ardently desires his wife to conceive should, with her
consent, concentrate their unions so far as possible on
such dates.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that
the effect on the whole nervous system of the desire
to conceive is very great. A too frantic desire, which
leads to too frequently repeated unions, will probably
defeat itself, because it is not the mere coalescence
of the sperm with the ovum which completes conception,
it is also the attachment of that impregnated
ovum to the wall of the womb, and intense nervous
excitement may prevent that. Indeed, it has been
stated by a medical man of considerable weight in
the last century that there are women among those
races to whom sex-knowledge is not taboo who can
voluntarily control conception at will and consciously
expel an impregnated ovum by mere exercise of
nervous force. A woman in modern society who is
in a highly nervous condition, which may find
expression in her constant need of cigarettes or
excitement, may be (though this is by no means
universally true) frequently impregnated and at the
same time continually throwing off the impregnated
ovum before the settling down of that ovum, which
results in true conception, can take place. If, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the woman who urgently desires to be a mother
finds herself continuously smoking, or notes in herself
any other indication of a lack of placidity in her
nerves, she would do well&mdash;not merely to restrict her
smoking, which is nothing but a symptom of a
deeper need&mdash;but she would do well to restore so far
as possible a calm poise to her whole system by
longer sleep, more country air, plenty of fresh butter,
or whatever simple remedy it may be that will supply
her nerves with something lacking, and for which
she is unconsciously craving.</p>

<p>Although to many it may seem incredible, yet it
is not so rare as might be supposed, that the adult
pair may be married for years, and the wife still
physically a virgin owing to neither of the pair
knowing that penetration must be effected.
Amazing as it may seem, four or five such cases, all
of intelligent apparently average people, have come
to my direct knowledge in the course of one year
alone. Another cause, less extreme, is due to the
woman making full entry difficult or impossible by
not taking up a proper position during union. (See
also p. <a href="#Page_114">114</a>.) In such cases a knowledge of the true
details involved may speedily bring the desired
conception.</p>

<p>These very simple suggestions are of the kind
often overlooked by the medical specialist, to whom
a woman goes tremblingly asking if she is abnormally
formed in any way, because she does not get
the children she so much longs for. Such advice, of
course, will apply only to people who are essentially
normal and without deformity. For more serious
obstructions to parenthood, the pair, and not the
woman only, should seek medical advice.</p>

<p>A frequent mistake (made even by gynæcologists) is to
confuse menstruation with the "period of desire," which is
generally called "heat" in animals. Even in the most
authoritative recent text books, such phrases as "heat and
menstruation" are very common, thus coupling heat and
menstruation as though they were equivalents, while the
older books quite explicitly look on the menstrual period in
women as corresponding to desire of "heat" in animals.
This error has even been repeated very recently in the <cite>Proceedings</cite>
of the Royal Society of Medicine.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Some physiologists have studied this subject in several of
the higher animals, and now realise that the time of desire
is physiologically distinct from the phase which is represented
by menstruation in women. It seems to be fairly well
established that in women menstruation is caused by an
internal secretion of the ovaries (<i>c.f.</i> p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>), and is not
directly due to ovulation, though it must have some connection
with it.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The most that modern science appears to have attained
is briefly summarised in the following quotation from
Marshall ("The Physiology of Reproduction," p. 69):<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"According to Martin and certain other writers, the human,
female often experiences a distinct post-menstrual &oelig;strus
[Modern research has recognised a period when the female
animal is ready for impregnation, which is called the &oelig;strus,
and a preparatory series of physiological changes called the
pro-estrous phase.&mdash;M.C.S.], at which sexual desire is greater
than at other times; so that, although conception can occur
throughout the intermenstrual periods, it would seem probable
that originally coition was restricted to definite periods
of &oelig;strus following menstrual or pro-estrous periods in
women, as in females of other mammalia. On this point
Heape writes as follows: 'This special time for &oelig;strus in the
human female has very frequently been denied, and, no doubt,
modern civilisation and modern social life do much to check
the natural sexual instinct where there is undue strain on the
constitution, or to stimulate it at other times where extreme
vigour is the result. For these reasons a definite period of
&oelig;strus may readily be interfered with, but the instinct is, I
am convinced, still marked.'"</p>

<p>In nearly all wild animals there is a definite period for
sexual excitement, very commonly just at that time of the
year which fits into the span of gestation, so that the young
are born at the season which gives them the best chance to
grow up. In animals the period of desire, the ovulation (or
setting free of the female germ or unfertilised egg-cell) and
the time of the birth of the young, are all co-related harmoniously.
The male animal is only allowed to approach the
female when the natural longing for union is upon her.
Among human beings, the only race which seems to have
long periods of sexual quiescence at all comparable with those
natural to the animals are the Esquimaux, who appear to
pass many months without any unions of the men and
women.</p></blockquote>

"Sex and Society," 1907, Pp. 314) is here very apt, though he
had been speaking not of man, but of the love play and coyness
shown by female birds and animals.

<p>
"We must also recognise the fact that reproductive life must
be connected with violent stimulation, or it would be neglected
and the species would become extinct; and on the other hand,
if the conquest of the female were too easy, sexual life would be
in danger of becoming a play interest and a dissipation, destructive
of energy and fatal to the species. Working, we may assume, by
a process of selection and survival, nature has both secured and
safeguarded reproduction. The female will not submit to
seizure except in a high state of nervous excitation (as is seen
especially well in the wooing of birds), while the male must
conduct himself in such a way as to manipulate the female; and,
as the more active agent, he develops a marvellous display of
technique for this purpose. This is offset by the coyness and
coquetry of the female, by which she equally attracts and fascinates
the male, and practises upon him to induce a corresponding
state of nervous excitation."</p></div>
